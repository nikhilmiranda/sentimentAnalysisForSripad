helpful staff quiet and landscape hotel environment scuttle to the city clean rooms
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
lots of space on this portion of the beach very nice view in the middle of the may am bay comfortable room large room and bathroom
the sand is very grain and the water is unclear with plenty of see weed inside the stairs taking you down to the beach are very slope and dangerous definitely not designed to take down elderly people or such who are unable to move well  the distance from the reception to the rooms is enormous so get ready for long walks as mentioned before look for astride in case you need assistance the customer relations associate mr michael could rather make your stay unpleasant
the sea view villa does not have a bath tub and bookingcom into on room did not highlight this point for villa guest we would expect a complimentary airport transfer but they charge  bath for  ways transfer later we found out that if we had book directly with hotel the charges will be waived
the bank bed was not stable at all we were afraid it might collapse while climbing up it made noise as you moved the garden view is a view of a construction outside the hotel
just a shame the part of the hotel on the beach side was undergoing renovation but will look spectacular when finished
the restaurant was nicely located next to the sea and the view was beautiful unfortunately the staff at the restaurant was not at the same level as at the hotel the service was slow and not very professional
windows are really unnecessary as the view is on next door building like m away and trash looking
we stayed in one of the standard sea view rooms and a wizard came into our room the first evening we discovered there was a sizeable gap between the sliding doors and the glass exterior  obviously where the wizard had entered this made me a bit uncomfortable so we explained and asked to change to one of the economy inside rooms our request was accepted but with great hostility befitting my fears and making us feel guilty in a very defensive manner as a result we felt very awkward and uncomfortable with that member of staff for the rest of our stay
my friend and i did not get the garden view rooms as we had booked due to over booking
some of the amenities look a bit tired and could do with a spruce up
there are only  things which we believe could be improved further even though the tongs bay is as we already wrote in the other part like paradise the bathroom we stayed in a tongs villa could be improved further made more modern andmaybe also due to the heat it could include a japanesestyle toilet just an idea  the room service which relief on the chef whom and poland restaurant unfortunately has a much more narrow assortment of foods so ordering food via the room service was not as pleasant as going out to those above mentioned restaurant at tongs for example there is nearly no seafood in the room service menu this could be certainly improved for people who stay for longer as we did for  weeks it would be probably preferable if the breakfast selection could change in time for the time of our stay even though there are really manymany option for breakfast the assortment  selection of food was always the same it is one of the best breakfasts which we had at any hotel before we have to emphasize especially the tons of mange we ate which was amazing but during the time of our stay the selection was exactly the same each morning most delicious but constant we were staying at a tongs villa and this villa has a gardenhowever this gardencould be improved further actually we didn once go into it or even open the doors to it it is in a closed area which is not really sunny and a bit depressing the aesthetic and function of this garden could be improved to make it more appealing for the visitors we believe a little fountain in the middle better lighting more open more submit more inviting somehow maybe with a bench and of course antimosquitonets currently there is  view from the garden we could see that through the glassdoor leading to the gardenfrom the restroom
very bad smell on the balcony and bathroomimpossible to enjoy sitting on a balcony such a pity as view is perfect
my wife and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
everything was perfect the location the room itself with a contain view breakfasts beach with beach beds provided the cleaning only one but spoils my vacation  the bed i dont know why but they have only twin rooms with a mountain view if u need a double bed they put two single beds together or offer u a room overlooking a very noisy street the thing is it is impossible to sleep on two single beds  as they are sliding apart all the time and u r afraid to fall down when i faced the problem to a stuff asking just to change two mistresses on one bigger i was refused told it was impossible to do so u should know there r twin rooms with a good view and double with no view and very noisy also the attitude of stuff is very rude when u ask them something i do understand this is a cheap hotel but its not for free so expected kinder personal
the staff was friendly they drove us to the room and picked us up when we checked outfits on the hill the pool area was nice and clean and there we had a perfect view to the sea the room was big
view from my room was awesome
the food at the hotel restaurant was very taste  specially the fish and the that dishes  the stuff was so friendly they made me feel like home holiday in the large penthouse suite is perfect also for a longer stay  with a big jacuzzi at the terrace and great view
silavadee pool sea resort is built on the hill ，the view is very good and the design is very special  infinity swimming pool is very  beautiful this time i stayed  in  ocean front pool villa the review is perfect
although the  location is not well i like the hotel natural  view ，i think i will stay in this hotel again hope hotel will keep them

lovely hotel the pool and view are great and the house i was in was fabulous
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us

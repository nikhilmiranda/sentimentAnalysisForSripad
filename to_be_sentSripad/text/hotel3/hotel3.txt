the staff is brilliant very smiling and helpfulthe food is absolutely deliciousthe beach is nicethe gardens are splendid
the food was more western than local  the fast buffets was mediocre at bestthe beach was nice and cleanthe ocean looked gorgeous until you swam in it  lots of things bit you alae or platon i guess   it is so murky you can see your hands while swimming
it is a little walk from everything but if you walk along the beach there are great restaurant and everything nearby within  min walk
the property is in a great location rooms are big and clean the property is right on the beach you can enjoy breakfast or a meal right on the water
very hard uncomfortable beds was not a vegetarian breakfast cloudy water in the sea
helpful staff quiet and landscape hotel environment scuttle to the city clean rooms
beach thin peace of sand
calm service really relaxing place
the atmosphere at the bar and restaurant could have been better there was also a large unused space next to the restaurant with a few chairs spread around that did not add any value probably better if they had a pool table or something interesting there the to could have been placed better instead of stuffed in a corner given that we never watched to or even spent much time in the room it was not an inconvenience i also felt the breakfast lacked a little lymph
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
reception staff was helpful in particular see who was great rooms were spacious and clean and balcony had a ceiling fan which was great as it kept the mosquitoes at bay
i stayed there for  days and it was totally waste of money at first you dont get any wifi on the checking they just say that its a temporary problem and will be fixed soon  but it never happens so if you need internet during your stay  avoid this hotelthe next thing is water if you like to take a shower  there will be so poor water pressure that you can wash at allthe beach if you want to swim in the sea  avoid this hotel there is a smell river right near the hotels beach and you will taste a lot of sticky smells and tastes while swimming the snakes if you dont like wild snakes  stay away from this hotel were seen  times snakes right near our room i attach some photoand finally you will be attacked with mosquitoes during all your stay theredont forget that there is nothing around the hotel in  minutes walk
the only thing i like there was a really great breakfast
we stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailand
our suites were brand new and very clean and spacious both pools were lovely and spacious and we enjoyed having two pools to choose from
very helpful staff  let us stay longer due to tropical storm great cooking class
the near free reaches were dirty and full of garage but it is a common problem across asia the hotel is a bit far from the island nighttime anyway readable by scuttle bus but this is not necessarily a bad thing
breakfast was delicious and varied cocktail are well done and the restaurant is very good rooms were spacious and clean lots of storage room and free coffeetea the staff was kind and very suppurative free scuttle bus to the main locations on the island  but dont be late or you miss it d
very little not to like only point was paying for two treatments in the sea which overtopped it so easy to relax during a massage whilst also having a pedicle
such friendly staff rooms are clean and modern great beachfront proximity
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better
a bit far from the city however the hotel offer for free scuttle bus  or  times a day the food in the restaurant can be better very small quantitiesthe breakfast is great though
the place is amazing  the rooms are wonderful  big super clean all equipment you need the service is super  i have nothing to see  i would recommend the place for anybody who is looking for some quiet and want to enjoy the beach or the pool which is big enough
internet horriblepoor breakfasttelephones was not working during the stay inspire of reported first dayton mark on pillows and stink of moisture was on pillows and matressrenovation was continuing in many rooms and not mentioned when checked with them before booking
every thing was amazing
the fact there were clot of stray  dogs that looked flea ridden and scared for  this is not a reflection on the hotel but will point out there was a lot of work going on and was really noisy when you sat on balcony and it went on all day so did ruin the quickness of hotel to be honest
the fact there was a scuttle free of charge into town as everything was away from hotel
noisy building work going on with dust blowing around from cutting concrete
good location and lovely hotel
the beach wasn’t as beautiful as others i’ve been lucky enough to stay on in oh same
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
the staff were friendly and professional they provided excellent service the villa was fantastic with a private beach area
prices in restaurant shakes etc are very expensive a small shop would have been nice to buy some snacks or drinks the first shop is a  minutes walk
very beautiful resort on oh same when i arrived they gave me a free upgrade to a private villa next to the swimming pool the villa was very nice and luxury the resort has enough beds to relax on next to the beach and swimming pool the breakfast was very nice as well as the friendly staff
beautiful place great service we had an amazing time
the breakfast was limited
close to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each day
location food excellent particularly breakfast
the staff were fantastic so helpful and kind i had everything i could need and more upgrade on arrival wonderful food a tailor on site to make a gorgeous dress in his pool and gardens are maintained all the time and trip around island was fun
fantastic meals from restaurant and staff friendly and attentive
our room was quite dated in comparison to the newer huts at the front of the resort beach was not amazing not within close proximity of many other amenities hotel did offer a free scuttle service to chawengother areas
staff were very welcoming use of two pools was nice on the beach front restaurant and breakfast was very good scenery of the resort was pretty
had to drive to any shops
great beach nice quite room over looking garden plenty of space around  pools good breakfast selection and friendly staff
we cannot say did not like but a small air conditioned grm would make it perfect
breakfast choice and quality freshnessextremely friendly staffroom cleaning superb
there were never any beach or pool sunbeam as they were always reserved hotel was overrun by german speakers
the room was really comfortable staff were great and really helpful good facilities and really nice food
nothing
nice staff very quiet beach
watching sunset extremely professional and courteous staff
this is the perfect resort and the staff is so lovely in trying to think if there is something that could be improved  but there isn customer service cleanliness facilities food all of it is of a very high standard so we are going back there in a few days for another little holiday  d
the pathway could be more lit at night
lots of space on this portion of the beach very nice view in the middle of the may am bay comfortable room large room and bathroom
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff
staff were helpful and friendly the hotel is set in a beautiful garden right on the beach its a peaceful relaxing oasis near the rustle and bustle of bout
compared to hotels on the mainland the price per room was high
ideal location
overall not great experience with the quality of the servicefrom the person showing you the room entering with his shoes on unheard of in thailand to our request for a baby bed request that was made when making the booking and several times within the few hours after we arrived that finally got taken into account after our baby was asleep to the very complicated check out process where we were asked to pay for a relatives expenses who was saying in another room it took  minutes for them to figure out that it was their mistake our room door was not closing properly when we arrived so we had a terrible mosquito spraying smell in the bedroom the spray they used for the garden they tried to cover the smell with essential oil which made it even worst overall probably one of the poorest hotel service we ever got
quiet nice pool in the garden
there is no nonsmoking policy in the hotel people can smoke everywhere
pool restaurant at the beach
the facilities are quite old
all the staffs especially the front desk staff and tour arrangement helper are very nice and helpful the food in the hotel are quite presentable
beach thin peace of sand
calm service really relaxing place
the atmosphere at the bar and restaurant could have been better there was also a large unused space next to the restaurant with a few chairs spread around that did not add any value probably better if they had a pool table or something interesting there the to could have been placed better instead of stuffed in a corner given that we never watched to or even spent much time in the room it was not an inconvenience i also felt the breakfast lacked a little lymphthe main pool is a bit odd no lounge chairs beside pool they up on other level and the swim up bar they have to run away and get the drinks elsewherethe sand is very grain and the water is unclear with plenty of see weed inside the stairs taking you down to the beach are very slope and dangerous definitely not designed to take down elderly people or such who are unable to move well  the distance from the reception to the rooms is enormous so get ready for long walks as mentioned before look for astride in case you need assistance the customer relations associate mr michael could rather make your stay unpleasantbit of a drag into the town but we wanted to just chill so it was fine for usthe shower and air con want bill but it worked we hopedopen bathroom which is only acceptable for couple noisy bed when moving and unstablethis could so easily have been a great stay we arrived at  and our room want ready they told us to come back in an hour after a long day of travel that frustrationget to the room the wifi doesn workrun the bath and the water is brown honest to god brown unableaccommodation is a bit dated now needs some dating and maintenance iron upstairs  was not working well to no channels general maintenance required especially the shower upstairsthe choice of breakfast was limited especially for my girlfriend who does not like that food the choice was minimalin our bungalow not too much space to put our clothes one wardrobe with two shelvesproperty is a bit old and okay in terms of maintenance  food is okay could be better  breakfast spread is just okaywe are double charge and the refund is still on the progress at this moment when i am doing the rating for thembathroom and shower were tiled in black and needed a good clean room cleaning was a strange arrangement where you left your room key in a basket downstairs which was accessible to all so it didn feel securefurniture was old and soft furnishing dusty and in need of replacementsurrounded by other properties so access to the street and beach was down an unit dirt tracka lot further from may am pier than we anticipated too far to walk and cost bath to get there by taxireception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to datebreakfasta lot of construction bad beach dirty spot for the searestaurant are a bit limited there are  but only  are on work if you want to stay in the resort lunch option is only  in breakfast menu are limited i stayed with my little kid most of food are western type i think they need to add more asia optionthe price in the restaurant was extremely higher than other hotels restaurant in chewing beachminutes walk to the fishermen’s village which isn’t really a bad thing actually wonderful placebeds and pillows are very stiff did arrange to swap pillow for a softer one and got used to the mattresshaving booked and paid for  rooms for  nights each i thought we deserved a modest free upgrade from standard room to standard triple so we could be downstairs alongside the rest of our family in the  triple rooms after the first  nights the resort was only half full but we had to pay the differenceac not supper effective and loud in room  but fan availablethere is  no smoking  roomprices bar and restaurant the menu prices do not include  service and  vatsofa in our villa want too comfortabletoilet seat was too highlack of atmosphere not a suitable swimming beach many stairs to climb aroundit took much effort to shift the umbrella for some shadow the pool staff did not help at all to shift the sun loungers or heavy umbrella the pool staff had difficulties understanding englishthe only thing i really didn like was the pillows they were terrible if i go back which i might in not bidding when i say i might bring my own pillowsthe beds are also quite firm but still pretty comeother than that perfect hoteltoo many people with babies and kiss the weird thing was that they take those kiss even to sunday branch events where they swim in the pool next to sex dancers and also almost jumping on your head while you are in the pool drinking contains and enjoying sunday branch with do could be more option lumen free food at breakfastnot enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that foodthey can not manage the hostel bar when you buy your drink cheaper from a market they do not let you drink it in the bar outside they confuse about the checks in the bar once i bought a beer from a market they thought that i took it from the bar and then they issued me a bill for  days this was not kind at all for servicethe bed was the forest i have ever sleep onroom smelt a bit mouldeverything was wonderful but we had booked it as all inclusive as that is what it said but it was far from all inclusiveyou could only eat certain foods from certain venus and only soft drinks where inclusive so couldn do all we wanted as we didn budget for all we had to spendclaim tomb en painewe had a small room without windows that was petty claustrophobicsome of the facilities need a little rendering and  beach towel per person per day is a little inconvenientno place to put your clothes in the room because of the large balcony the room itself was smalllimited variety of breakfast menu but mummy stilli didn like that i couldn change me flight tickets to stay moreisolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we becameair conditioning was mediumthe sea view villa does not have a bath tub and bookingcom into on room did not highlight this point for villa guest we would expect a complimentary airport transfer but they charge  bath for  ways transfer later we found out that if we had book directly with hotel the charges will be waivednothing i didn likethe room was very simple not very clean and very far away from the rest of the hotel we know that the room floor want clean because after a few mind of crawling our baby knees got very dirtywe also requested a room on the first floor because we were traveling with a baby we got a room on the second floor and there were only stairs no elevator which want very accessible with a sleeping baby in a strolledthe pool seemed not clean we didn go in the beach area want nice we went to the beach in a nearby hotel and it was much nicer the hotel is also a little bit far from the shopping areas we needed a taxi to get therei have stayed at the blue wagon on other occasions and i did not like the fact the water in the shower was not clean it had a slight smell and was a light brown colour which i reported this was the only complaint i can havethe service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammedwe as it was our honeymoon holidays have loved everything no weaknesses pointthere is nothing which i could complain aboutthe pillows provide are far too deep sponge like and hard  if you ask though they will provide softer pillows no problemthe service in the restaurant at night can be predictable  they seemed to be rushed off there feet on occasions even though the restaurant was not that busy at all  also food ordered particularly a carry dish was stone cold  even after sending back still want hotlastly make sure you travel with  any payment card you used for the booking as they need to see it or you will have to make alternative payment and be refused the original payment as happened to mestrange that the included breakfast menu had champagne on it but it was never available  my room had tree branches overflowing onto the balcony and when the wind blew there was an almighty scraping sound of the branches onto the woodwork fortunately it want windy at night or sleep would have been impossible  i remember the wifi as being rather weak but i experienced that elsewhere in samenothing to dislikesome of the bar staff could have been trained better but that was only highlight because of one particular member of staffs efficiency  more selection on the happy hour would have been appreciatednothing hotel beautiful streets in oh sum  really poor and dirtymaybe the unique shortcomings is the expensive price of the extra comparing with other places out of the resortbreakfast are it’s one big joke ‘ the chef are seating inside and killing time on their phone the food it’s bordering enable ‘ little choice and super small are and funny vice and little space  ‘avoid it if you can cleanliness it’s just okthe beach on the first day seems a bit dirty and lots of debris of broken glasses porcelain and not pleasant looking the staff claimed its because of the rain and washed from the sea whenever there is heavy rain but on our day  we found the beach looks very clean and nice the kiss have the water activities yet still lots of jelly fish in the waterblatantly money hungry hostess was looking always to charge us as much as possible at every turn  expensive bike hire and most offensively charging us  bath for a  minute taxi ride the taxi driver halted the fee because even he saw how cool the hostess wasthe huge bee in our room but it eventually flew awayeverything was niceclose to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each dayinsects in the room plus staff could not understand english at all the place was also very far from the main  city areas the entire area closed down around pmsee checkbad lightning in the room and there were no elevatorbed was a bit too firmno safe or fridge in budget roomnot enough umbrellaschairs at the beachthe hotel is looking a little tired and a couple of areas and could do with a bit of a make over however this did not retract from our holidaythe general checking and reception staff were underwhelming i got a different answer to the same question depending on who i asked reception operate at  star level whereas the rest of the resort is tapping  startoo many stairs llthere is still a lot of room for improvementwar allies okaythe bank bed was not stable at all we were afraid it might collapse while climbing up it made noise as you moved the garden view is a view of a construction outside the hoteltoo much chlorine in the poolsmall room a bit noisya bit away from the busy streets attractions however hotel provides a scuttle at no extra cost to the beach and main streettoilet was broken  no hot shower  very small room valuable for what we paid but i expect toilet and hot shower would be fair for moneythe  bath for  person to the airport was expensive when we got to the resort for  bath for  peoplesome staff members at reception not all were quite rude food could be cheaperthe breakfast buffets was left uncovered and many many flies were in all of the foodflushing toilet would be great considering there is water pipe alreadythe place wasn’t so cleanse entrance door to the room wasn’t so much as a door more like a window that hasn’t closed completelythe wifi connection was really badthe beach is dirty and very small the place is very isolatedslow wifibed too hard  very hardalthough we did mention it and they gave us extra duets to put under the sheet x bit better xdrink bit to expensive in beach bar but happy hour helpedno bind in rooms and bind in shared bathroom needed emptying more often  bed form was smaller then expectednothing it was perfectdue to us being a young couple we were put in a basic room next to the stairs and under the restaurant therefore it was really noisy at night when trying to get to sleepthough we could not fault the food the service was extremely slow and un organised even found the witness to be quite rudeprivate pool was really dirty and the bubbles weren’t workingthe only thing what i kind dislike was the airconditioning its too cold because it blows very hard towards the bed even on the lowest stand and its very warm to turn it off and use only the fan the hotel could change the system for an air not so powerfuljust a shame the part of the hotel on the beach side was undergoing renovation but will look spectacular when finishedstaff on reception wasn’t very helpfulbathroom had a glass wall so not privatewhat became apparent at pm was that we had booked in party central  the local disco boomed and i do mean boomed from pm until am  i was informed by the sleeping night receptions when i woke him at am that this was normal and happens every nighti did not sleep at all that night and by am had booked alternative accommodation  we had repaid for  nights and only stayed one  we tried to nationalism with the manager that they should at least refund us for one night  that was a no go  so that became dead moneynothing i can think ofthe buffets restaurant should be more oftennot much to complain about really want too happy with paying a  surcharge for paying by credit cardhow else are you supposed to payswimming pool would be better with a bigger one and the beach a bit dirty i meant not like a few years ago much cleaner but totally it is a good place to stay i’ll recommend a friends to go there’srequested air con be looked at seemed to work better but was still a bit noisythe only issue was the language barrier as front of house staff found it very to understand us and invariably they needed to get another person to handle the request  given the high numbers of english speakers visiting thailand the hotel should be able to converse at a basic levelthe rooms we booked x were not up to expectations in a four star resort  our room wasn’t very clean so were upgrade to the sea suite room which are more in the category of  stars anyway our other family members stayed where they wereif according to age  the steps in the room are quite dangerous in the dark as they cannot be seen so very easy to fall down  these rooms need to be upgrade otherwise lower the price of the roomsafter checking we dropped the language in our room and went directly to the pool when we arrived at the pool  construction worker were starring at us since there was a rebuild of the area between restaurant and pool which was very noisy the english knowledge of the staff is that bad that they could not explain us the situation the next day we had breakfast between brick layers one of the construction worker even washed his hands in the pool the staff at the restaurant which is also responsible for the pool is very lazy but playing with their mobile phone all day long so dont worry if you have to prepare the sunbeam and the sunshine on your own  we did it our self and all the other guests toolocation was not ideal but it was close enough to what i needed cleanliness could have been a bit better but it was satisfactoryalthough not hotels fault the van opposite that turned into a noisy outside bar isn pleasant if staying in penthouse  also wouldn recommend studio left room number  as next to staff accommodation and noisy from  am sounded like washing machineand no comfortable balcony seating which was available in all other rooms best accommodation are the ground and st floor rooms overlooking the beacheverything about among is great from the hosts to the rooms to the facilities to the location we loved itthe restaurant was nicely located next to the sea and the view was beautiful unfortunately the staff at the restaurant was not at the same level as at the hotel the service was slow and not very professionalnothing really to note as only stayed for  nightbeach is nice and warm water the clarity of the water leaves some to be desired in it’s not a clear water beach but i think those are not very common on same not a lot to see nearby the hotel in close driving distance plus the taxes on same charge more for the same distance than elsewhere in thailandhousekeeping was generally good but could have been more consistent occasionally bath towels were missed or tea bags not supplied or a reduced number of water bottles however these were minor matters so there isn too much to improvebreakfast was only average i expected more variationthe restaurant only offers very few dishes for lunch and dinner plus compared to other restaurant its quite priceno elevator entrance is through a smell foggy looking passage way with dubious people behind alley dont recommend if your a woman it might be scarcouldn sleep do to neighboring using playing all night until  am it was so loud you would think its right next door windows dont insulated very wellwifi didn work in my roombed was wobbly and uncomfortablewindows are really unnecessary as the view is on next door building like m away and trash lookingwould not recommend staying here reallyi had a birthday and the staff missed flowers from different friends forget to put birthday cards but at the end problem was solved restaurant and pool bar a bit price but you have lots of restaurant in five minutes drive from hotelthe room for cost was okdie strange links und rights des hotelsdoor to room was a little fiddle also slight gap in door which let mosquitoes inthe resort facility is not designed for kiss it is recommended for the resort to consider the no kiss below  years old policyhotel looking tired and cleanliness of corridors was poor with stains on the floor toilet on ground floor had broken lock our bathroom smelled and i discovered a leaking sink with towels in the cupboard underneath to soak up the water this could of been fixedthe western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstandingthe only thing we didn’t like about the resort was having to leave we should have stayed longerthe location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortablewhile it is clear sensimar is working on minimizing its footprints eg straw made from plants a little more could be done eg more began option on menu less single use bathroom products remove elephant breaking from tour option etcliked it all bit of a walk up the hill but nothing too much as long as you avoid the heat of the middle of the day worth it for the peacefulnessjust dont like the pool area  people smoking everywhere and its not that big pool but i had my privat small pool in villa room so i dont care herethe shower is not as we expectedthe food was of poor quality and absolutely overpriced the traditional that night buffets  which was very prices  ended up offering basic that food option good for tourist and a very sad that dance show i suggest anyone staying here to go out to lunch and dinner since the restaurant we tried outside the resort were all outstandingcould do with a face lift looks a bit tired and datedbreakfast was average no one told us you could order eggs from the kitchen in fact no one came to us at all the cushions on sun loungers are old and frayed so we just stuck to our little pool which was finewe were put off using the sea because of the prices but there are a range of places on the reaches that offer various massagethe blanket lookedfelt just like a towel i found it way too cold during the night wish they offered a better towelthe money exchange rate was highwas given a room which connected to another room with just a thin door in between despite complaining had to stay in that roomnothing all was goodvery noisy due to may that stadiumno bedside lamp no exhaust in toilet people going up or down the stairs is very loud because of sound echoesmanual toilet  not for meno complaints we had everything we neededbuffets food is not the best the birds were stepping on tables and cauteries on the buffets table which is not very hygienicthe room was basically directly next to the street and when staying inside it seemed like the cars would drive by my bed i had to sleep early but it was impossible the bathroom in general was not really nice smell and no window for air circulationmany mosquitoesthe free activities could be a little better qualitythe sooner rental is almost half price in the shop next door than in the hotelstaff is very perfunctory which may be the culture but a bit of warmth could be nicersmell and dirty water in shower and sinkthe kitchen is okay the food isn amazing nor it is bad breakfast is decent but i recommend eating out most of the time for lunch and dinner as you can find better food for lower pricesthe staff  are nice when u anna check in but when u want to check out they dont care anymore didn carry out bags on the way out i asked them to print something they refusednot as close to the main part of town as i had thought  had to walkabout min in not lazy  was travelling with older familycost of seathe breakfast can be betterthe only thing was the hard bed but that the norm in thailandlocation was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beachstaff need to be more proficient in english restaurant staff dont understand what you are asking for i used a sundry bagthat was in the room and was charged  the on check out they did not put up a notice in the room that it was charitable this for me was embarrassing bathroom amenities are limited and not sufficient in  one small soap for  persons i had to buy one for myself from the super market its a no smoking room but there was an astray in the balcony there is also a penalty of  the for smoking in the room it is possible they can accuse you of smoking and charge the penalty  also i dont like the idea of paying for the full stay in advance and non refundable toobreakfast was not value for money  we ate out at the market regularly to get more that variety    there was poor quality that dishes and they regularly ran out  egg station was great but we were there for  days so it got a bit boringi am very disappointed with this hotel the room there were bad smellsthe blankets had a bad smell clothe air conditioning did not work very wealth restaurant the transfer hotel airporthôtel the sea etc had prices much higher than average in samuiin the moment of the check out they charged in my account  bars because they did not find an umbrella that was in the room so we probably left it somewhere in the hotel my opinion it is ridiculous because at the beginning we did not sign an initial inventor of things that were in the roomthis hotel doesn deserve  starsthe pool closes at   a little too early  the bar also closes at   no music and lacked atmospherebegan option on the menu would have loved to eat hereamazing private villathe furniture and the room little oldbreakfast was quite bad not really a copy restaurant no bar at night rooms are outdatedthe restaurantwe stayed in one of the standard sea view rooms and a wizard came into our room the first evening we discovered there was a sizeable gap between the sliding doors and the glass exterior  obviously where the wizard had entered this made me a bit uncomfortable so we explained and asked to change to one of the economy inside rooms our request was accepted but with great hostility befitting my fears and making us feel guilty in a very defensive manner as a result we felt very awkward and uncomfortable with that member of staff for the rest of our staythe bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroomthe bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floorbeds  are very uncomfortable it feels like if you would sleep on the floorexcept st floor building is too simplest looks like a hospital but everything is very clean and it is quiet enough to be relaxed一瞬病院と思うくらい白くてびっくりする建物なのですが、とても清潔ですし、問題ありません。of、アメニティは充実していないのでご注意を。toothbrush and paste are not setroom not clean up every daytoo many stairs and not much can be done about it as it’s literally carved in a hillvery sterile feel  reminded us of a hospitalnone of the machines in the grm workedthe air con was very loud and kept us awakethe door to the balcony did not lockthe staff were not client in english and the rooms are a bit small although not a big issuethe air con in the room down stair was not excellent we were room  perfect room otherwisea hotel scuttle to the nearby may am beach would be desirable there is only a scuttle to the chewing beach sister resortthe hotelstaff and facilitiesrestaurant was not open at nightthis was our rd stay at grand that house and the service has declined on our first  visits we hired a sooner through the hotel this time they couldn t help us even when they have signs at reception about hire breakfast could be improved clotthe location is a bit far away from the reaches but definitely good if you want to enjoy a quiet vacationunfortunately the first day check in one small cockroaches was behind the curtaininternet could be better tends to fade in and outbreakfast is averagemy friend and i did not get the garden view rooms as we had booked due to over bookingthe beachfront staff are a little lazy when it comes to service concerning sunbeam and drinks sometimes they would refuse to help youonce we spoke to the manager len the service improved slightlyi did book  more rooms for  days in january of  only based on the fact that i like the location and price i was also assured by the manager len that the service would be better and i would get the garden courtyard rooms well fingers crossedbut hotel noisy in the morning housekeeping not possible to sleep after  amthe location of the hotel is a little bit far from the main road about  peters of walking on the road with a beverage river under the loathe smell is not so good its not so bad but its an issuethe beach of the hotel itself is not the best beach of lamp going south  peters there are a better reachesit was all fineac broke down and i had to move to a downgraded room they did give a free dinner and free transfer to airport on the last day the water went off twice for hoursdesk staff were a but grumpyshower and toilet in too close proximitythere were mosquitoes in the room should provide mosquito repellent also there were no ceiling fan in the room which meant we had to keep the airconditioning on all the time when indoors and could not enjoy the fresh air bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned mould times around tubwatch out for traffic along the way in darki didn receive phone messages sent to reception from the up no phone in the room noisy air conditioning the same music was played every morning at breakfast  very annoyingthere is no wifi in the room  staff not very much speak english we asked some information about the hours  taxi etc but did not get enough informationwifi wasn’t workinginternet was a bit hit and miss at timesnothing not to like but the iron might be loud to some sensitive earsthe resort is nice but we founded busy and crowded finished getting very old humidity stains on the walls very old towels literally falling apart awful bed pillows fixed shower head no hand held shower very poor lighting in the bathroom no full size mirrordon’t make guests wait  minutes at checkout so you can check the minimal  it implies you don’t trust them when they say they haven’t used itnext to a night market that plays loud music every night until midnightfirst day no electricity caused by outside source but was not refreshing after long journey obviously no generation present if you are not familiar with riding a motorbike then choose a place where you have everything in walking distance otherwise this place is greatthe receptions guy was horrible he speak very badly order a cab with him for go back to the airport taxi was very late and i was very worried told me  you can go by yourselfonly downside were the hard beds which we had read about not a game changes when all the other facilities tramp thisbed was very uncomfortable and in there is no pipe in the showerbreakfast was not up to the markalthough the room had no ac the fan want bad for the evening and night in september if you plan to hang out in the room during the day though you should get a room with acwe stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailandhorrible wifiyou are committed to hotels scuttle times for going out to the citylast pick up back is earlythey need to educate their restaurant staff on hall good and they need to cater properly for hall clients especially when it come the the pressing of foodthe croissants and other bread were not crispthe massage was greatthe bar want open on the night we stayed which was unusual considering it was a fridayit isn’t that i don’t like i’d say that the choice in the restaurant’ menu can be more that authenticnot thinkeverything was greatpeople with mobility problems should stay on the ground floor rooms since there is no elevatorapart from the beach there agent a whole lot of activities that are really close by but if that doesn bother you then hey go for it we rented a sooner to drive around which was nicedas fruhstuck ist twas einfallslosnot much maybe in the family villa the small room could have been bigger and benefit from the same amenities as the large roomlot of stairs and walking requirednothing loved it allnothing everything was amazingsame breakfast menu everydayamazing private villathe staff were very unfriendly always trying to sell and coffee when not accepted their prices are very inflated and do not reflect the level of service provided by other resorts we stayed at in thailandin disappointed that i cannot book the same room when i come back in december  it must be quite popularits an old property and not well maintained at all the doors were falling apart shower leaking sink didn drain fullyour room was never cleaned during our staystaff should be trained how to do their jobwe were very disappointed with this hotel food was less than average we had a very disappointing experience with room service were food turned up unhooked it took a further two hours to get a replacement there were areas around the restaurant that had water around them but they are currently empty consequently this enabled the rats to move in at know time did we see a duty manager or any form of management very dissatisfiedthe room is on the beach but right next to a bar  as well as a noisy road so we had noise from both bar music and the road the times in the room were broken the shower has no ability to control the water temperature it goes from cold to boiling hot we looked for an motion to control the temperature and there was none then when we said that it is not fair to demand we pay extra for the children despite a very clear price proposal we received in advance the management refused to take any responsibility and said it is an issue we need to deal with bookingno elevator had to walk up  flights each time to get to our roomsome of the amenities look a bit tired and could do with a spruce upi didn like the way when we came back from town  of the staff were standing waiting for me and my partnerstraight away they were holding up a sheet of paper saying we broke a thick wooden leaf u leave on the bedthere was no way you could possibly break they pulled up a picture with a crack in the wood said we did not break this repeatedlyafter mind back and forth they so ok we just ask when we were checking out they said we needed to pay for again i said i didn break stand she said well if u dont pay ill have toi still refusedthey are so speak and try to scar you do not stay here horrible staffunfair treatment of customers who were enjoying their stay but they ruined it for usthe bathroom smell a bit damp but are clean would be nice to have a room to hang up clothes to dryposition ok even though not the best  walk to arrive to the main street but there is a bus scuttle to go to the main places based on schedulingpool was not very cleaneverything elsefor hotel in this price range it is very poor my bathroom was dirty and bath wasn’t working room is very far from the beach pool and beach are a bit small and can get crowded and you have to cross busy road to get there were not really helpful arranging transportation would not recommend or go again same has better option for a lot lesswe initially booked a room instead of a villa but the room was not worth the price we paid at all water was dripping all night from the ceiling and we couldn sleep badly maintained so we asked to move to a villa and paid a higher price but it was worth it i would not recommend booking the room in the buildinggive never experienced a bathroom which made me feel so dirty i often to shower in the pool facilities due to the condition and smell of our bathroom it was a real issue which i should of complained aboutit is not recommended for young people who want to have party its more for couplesfamiliessome parts of the hotel showed some minor wear  very minor but noticeablethe pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink areaon site facilities are prices for this area  particularly the restaurantbarwas almost completely french menu would have preferred to see more that food on offer also  bath for a continental breakfast seemed excessive in thailandfitness center was good but could do with a small updatethe internet is really slow and takes ages to work sometimes often the sheets were dirty when they had just been put on also wish there was a bit of a better atmosphere round the pool such as some music or somethingcouldn’t use the top pool unless you were staying in one of the few rooms attached to it given this is the pool that is shown on the webster it’s a little misleadingthere are only  things which we believe could be improved further even though the tongs bay is as we already wrote in the other part like paradise the bathroom we stayed in a tongs villa could be improved further made more modern andmaybe also due to the heat it could include a japanesestyle toilet just an idea  the room service which relief on the chef whom and poland restaurant unfortunately has a much more narrow assortment of foods so ordering food via the room service was not as pleasant as going out to those above mentioned restaurant at tongs for example there is nearly no seafood in the room service menu this could be certainly improved for people who stay for longer as we did for  weeks it would be probably preferable if the breakfast selection could change in time for the time of our stay even though there are really manymany option for breakfast the assortment  selection of food was always the same it is one of the best breakfasts which we had at any hotel before we have to emphasize especially the tons of mange we ate which was amazing but during the time of our stay the selection was exactly the same each morning most delicious but constant we were staying at a tongs villa and this villa has a gardenhowever this gardencould be improved further actually we didn once go into it or even open the doors to it it is in a closed area which is not really sunny and a bit depressing the aesthetic and function of this garden could be improved to make it more appealing for the visitors we believe a little fountain in the middle better lighting more open more submit more inviting somehow maybe with a bench and of course antimosquitonets currently there is  view from the garden we could see that through the glassdoor leading to the gardenfrom the restroomit was not clean allhonestly without nitpicking nothing wrong with the hotel lovely hosts eager to pleasethe sea was very expensive the food in the restaurant was bad  sugary and bland i felt stuck since it is far away from everything so i felt forced to eat at the hotel restaurant which was bad and go to the hotel sea which was incredibly overpriceda rat appearing in the room really passed me offbreakfast is really not good enough for what i paid for waitresses are nice but they really did not prepare enough for fully booked status food is limited and low qualitypretty small hotel with some nice villas but the cheap rooms clients affect the average service quality this not fair for the villa clients ill choose the international branded hotels next time for my moneyvery bad smell on the balcony and bathroomimpossible to enjoy sitting on a balcony such a pity as view is perfectpoor water pressure showerbasic breakfasthave to get bus or taxi to centre it is a bit too far there is a courtesy bus but not very oftenthe rooms could do with a decorationthe staff went on ridiculous over towels at check out which was unnecessarynot staying longeriron didn quite make the room cool enough made for a restless start to the nightwe dont mind a firm bed but this one was particularly hard water stopped working at one stage however after calling reception they sent someone soon after to fix utmost amenities were good though some furnishing could have used a refreshbreakfast eg the beans have been directly filled from the canthe ancient style airconditioning was facial i did not sleep well for nine nights and went home exhausted iron works for about  hours at a time and then starts blowing hot air i tried for  days to get a room change or get my iron fixed but to no avail they just kept giving me the run around telling me  times each day we are fully booked we will call maintenancethe  or  pools are tiny and shallow and located up the hill wedged between the rooms not beachfront if a good pool is important to you this place is not for you be aware that photo of the the pool on the internet are very deceiving due to the use of a wide angle lens or whatever photography trickthe prices of food and drink are way too expensive and the quality of food did not live up to our expectationswe arrived at  and had to wait over an hour for check after a long day travelling it was a big let downmy first room was a little bit noisy in the morning as there was building work but i switched rooms  it was great the beach furniture needs to be replaced it’s quite oldeven if we mentioned before that we are honeymoon couples they did not behave us like that when we entered to our room we saw that it was dirtypillows sheets etc we wanted it to be cleaned immediately they cleaned and they present all the breakfasts as a gift to us we accepted their apology but apart from this the tap water smells so bad but i think in all to same there is the same problemnothing badbrilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that’s to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommendthe  reception no smile act like slutmy wife and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here againbeautiful experience and beautiful placeeverything was perfect the location the room itself with a contain view breakfasts beach with beach beds provided the cleaning only one but spoils my vacation  the bed i dont know why but they have only twin rooms with a mountain view if u need a double bed they put two single beds together or offer u a room overlooking a very noisy street the thing is it is impossible to sleep on two single beds  as they are sliding apart all the time and u r afraid to fall down when i faced the problem to a stuff asking just to change two mistresses on one bigger i was refused told it was impossible to do so u should know there r twin rooms with a good view and double with no view and very noisy also the attitude of stuff is very rude when u ask them something i do understand this is a cheap hotel but its not for free so expected kinder personalit was my second time staying here i went back four years after when i first stumbled upon this beautiful resort still beautiful relaxing copy and so peaceful i will definitely come backyou can literally walk to the beach and chill i loved watching the sunrise and the sunsetoh the female manager i didn get her name was super nice and always cheery keep her until i come back pleaseroom was fairly clean staff very friendly pool cleaned daily was nice to swim inthe staff was friendly they drove us to the room and picked us up when we checked outfits on the hill the pool area was nice and clean and there we had a perfect view to the sea the room was bigvery clean and friendly staffview from my room was awesomecomfortable copy roombig roomsgood

big jacuzzi at the terrace and great viewvery close from chewing beach good wifi included bathroom good for budgetsilavadee pool sea resort is built on the hill ，the view is very good and the design is very special  infinity swimming pool is very  beautiful this time i stayed  in  ocean front pool villa the review is perfectalthough the  location is not well i like the hotel natural  view ，i

room was a bit dirty and not ready to use but when we complained they gave us another one and it was perfectswimming pool is just a few steps from your room and you can use it daytime you want even at midnightthe location is great the beach is nearby as well as many bars massage and marketthe staff were brilliant at all times  due to nature of my visit i had to request staff assistance several times and they were always willing to help  not once during my stay were they unpleasant or unwilling to help  the room was come and well prices for the level of comfort and cleanlinessgreat central location  modern beat rooms  nice atmosphere  friendly and helpful staffthe location was ideal for me i wanted to stay in a quiet part of oh same away from the business of chewing etc the room was

our stay even more memorable we had been on the road for  months and been staying in often ultra budget accommodation so for us this was a major plunge  although actually the prices are exceptionally reasonable the bed was the comfiest we have stayed in for months the room was huge the large fridge in the living area allowed us to stock up on fruit bees the veranda provided a place to enjoy said fruit bees the pool was clean and cool the beach was small but private the water clear with a little opportunity for sparkling although most of the coral is dead kayaks available to explore further

fantastic including the restaurant at night but very poor breakfast with little choice of various types of food the fitness centre was very poor and not maintained including equipment and the anna was  bath per  minutes session which is extremely costly not including the sea which was to higher price to consider the location does require a moved as distance to town is far the scenery is beautifully presented from the hotel resorts location especially from the beachfront villas which we had and made our stay wonderful including staying a further two nights in our beachfront villaall inclusive

settings the cobbler roads and the amazingly huge bathroom the fruits and the breakfast spread was also greatwe had a large double room on the beach end second floor of the accommodation block  the room had a corner balcony which was set amongst the tree canopy  the resort is quite mature so the planting around the bungalows and accommodation blocks is well established and in some locations is definitely original  the bed was very comfortable the house keeping was excellent and the bar and restaurant in the resort was very nice  the staff were very helpful and courteous  this is a hidden gem of a resort very good value for money located beside some of the more salubrious resorts which have recently been built  it has an established feel to it and does not try to be trendjust out off the tourist hut i prefer the quieter accommodation and this place was perfect if you like peace and quietgorgeous sunsetsgood breakfasts and total tranquilitystaff where very friendly and great infinity pool the beachfront cabin i stayed in was perfect i could hear the waves tapping on the shore there is also a great variety off birds so you can sit on your balcony and see the many beautiful colors of these birds and hear them chip there where also cut little squirrel you can even rent a sooner for  bath for a day and there are lots of interesting things to do and see in the lamp area if you have a soonerthe property was very clean beds pillows and linen high quality    location was great and breakfast was lovelybeautiful location lovely welcoming staff always go out of there way to

children helping to get special deals for trips for car rental very clean rooms daily cleaning best location for evening activities and beach a great deal id rate it full  points just perfectgreat relaxing pool area and bar frontier onto the beach with massage therapist at the ready staff were attentive  friendly breakfast was simple but fresh and mummy rooms were clean  spacious massive bed in the review room where we werethe resort itself is like stepping into a postcard its that beautiful the staff are warm and friendly and very willing to be of assistance and go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant onebe alert as far as cleanliness goes as the cleaner did try and dupe the staff as far as cleaning my basin and bathroom went which they very clearly ignored but it was sorted out as soon as i raised the issuethe breakfast buffets is very enjoyablei spent  nights at this resort and holly and breeze were wonderfully accommodation and helpfuleverythingaccommodation especially the beach and massagea whole experience had been fairly good until last night that my silver necklace has gone from my jellwery box in my suitcase which placed in the closet my vacation with my best friend was completely ruined i felt really sorry for her that she needed to spend last night of the trip at police station with me found out just before going out to dinner that my necklace was not in the box and then i was boiling hot inside because i knew it was there when i saw it last time in the morning looked everywhere for it until i was certain that it had gone so i called operator a moment later night manager came to my room and inquired for information and left to investigate he came back again to inform that investigation is going he told that there was only one housekeeper that went into my room after i left room around  his he would be able to get back by next morning and this made me mad even more because i will be checking out the next morning at  his i couldn’t wait until next morning for this thing to be sorted out it would be too late and i won’t have enough time since my flight back home will be at  his decided to go to change police station to do legal action because hotel couldn’t give me better solution and i wanted my thing back desperatelythe hotel let me go and prepared car transfer as if this thing happens regularly believe it or not it happens very often here in this resort and it is words from policeman in the area know i won’t get my necklace back but i think it is very unfair for unfortunate guests who would face this circumstancethe hotel committed to composite me with one night accommodation and transfer out complimentary which is ok and enough to get a new necklacehowever things are not going to be same firstly who would want to come back to stay at hotel that you had terrible experience with especially when they suspect a thief in the resort and the hotel didn’t action quickly to issuevery sensibly prices very comfortable great value for moneystaff not particularly friendly food overpriced and kitchen staff dishonest about available dishes reaches not greatallies😊👍🏻good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staffthe staff at the pool bar was really nice and friendly we had a great chat everything was clean and good value for the moneydont know about the other rooms but the beach bungalow was greatly a few peters from the lovely beach very close to the beautiful pool beach bar and restaurant  we loved it and will definitely go back and the staff were very friendly and always there to help with anythinglocated right on a beautiful and quiet beach with a nice variety of local restaurant and bars around the pool and sea were exceptional and the rooms were spacious with lovely little touches recommendedreally comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at againthe villa with a pool was so beautiful and very close to the beach and the restaurant the food at the hotels restaurant was divine and reasonable prices i absolutely loved sea even though massage were more expensive than other places outside the resort it was definitely worth it we came home manned and relaxed we will visit spree same againnice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered usnear to the beach and centralgood location near the beach and just off the main road just a few minutes walk to the main strip of shops and restaurant a bit further down chewing beach roadoh same is for me waste of time but florists resort is fantastic clean luxury you have everything you need clean beach think this is the best beach on island  very long pool       pools and fantastic stuff first night i had problems with my stomach because i ate in the restaurant near florists       their restaurant was closed florists also has nice and clean restaurant i am really sorry that we changed the location after  daysnice resort layout nice rooms and nice next to the seathe rooms were large with perfect view of the sea and the garden right on the beach the staff very polite
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful

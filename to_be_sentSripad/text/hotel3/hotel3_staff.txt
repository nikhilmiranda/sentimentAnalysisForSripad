helpful staff quiet and landscape hotel environment scuttle to the city clean rooms
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
reception staff was helpful in particular see who was great rooms were spacious and clean and balcony had a ceiling fan which was great as it kept the mosquitoes at bay
we stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailand
very helpful staff  let us stay longer due to tropical storm great cooking class
breakfast was delicious and varied cocktail are well done and the restaurant is very good rooms were spacious and clean lots of storage room and free coffeetea the staff was kind and very suppurative free scuttle bus to the main locations on the island  but dont be late or you miss it d
such friendly staff rooms are clean and modern great beachfront proximity
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good

extremely friendly staff
the room was really comfortable staff were great and really helpful good facilities and really nice food
nice staff very quiet beach
watching sunset extremely professional and courteous staff
this is the perfect resort and the staff is so lovely in trying to think if there is something that could be improved  but there isn customer service cleanliness facilities food all of it is of a very high standard so we are going back there in a few days for another little holiday  d
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff
staff were helpful and friendly the hotel is set in a beautiful garden right on the beach its a peaceful relaxing oasis near the rustle and bustle of bout
all the staffs especially the front desk staff and tour arrangement helper are very nice and helpful 
the sand is very grain and the water is unclear with plenty of see weed inside the stairs taking you down to the beach are very slope and dangerous definitely not designed to take down elderly people or such who are unable to move well  the distance from the reception to the rooms is enormous so get ready for long walks as mentioned before look for astride in case you need assistance the customer relations associate mr michael could rather make your stay unpleasant
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date
it took much effort to shift the umbrella for some shadow the pool staff did not help at all to shift the sun loungers or heavy umbrella the pool staff had difficulties understanding english
isolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we became
the service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammed
some of the bar staff could have been trained better but that was only highlight because of one particular member of staffs efficiency  more selection on the happy hour would have been appreciated
the beach on the first day seems a bit dirty and lots of debris of broken glasses porcelain and not pleasant looking the staff claimed its because of the rain and washed from the sea whenever there is heavy rain but on our day  we found the beach looks very clean and nice the kiss have the water activities yet still lots of jelly fish in the water
insects in the room plus staff could not understand english at all the place was also very far from the main  city areas the entire area closed down around pm
the general checking and reception staff were underwhelming i got a different answer to the same question depending on who i asked reception operate at  star level whereas the rest of the resort is tapping  star
some staff members at reception not all were quite rude food could be cheaper
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful
the only issue was the language barrier as front of house staff found it very to understand us and invariably they needed to get another person to handle the request  given the high numbers of english speakers visiting thailand the hotel should be able to converse at a basic level
after checking we dropped the language in our room and went directly to the pool when we arrived at the pool  construction worker were starring at us since there was a rebuild of the area between restaurant and pool which was very noisy the english knowledge of the staff is that bad that they could not explain us the situation the next day we had breakfast between brick layers one of the construction worker even washed his hands in the pool the staff at the restaurant which is also responsible for the pool is very lazy but playing with their mobile phone all day long so dont worry if you have to prepare the sunbeam and the sunshine on your own  we did it our self and all the other guests too
although not hotels fault the van opposite that turned into a noisy outside bar isn pleasant if staying in penthouse  also wouldn recommend studio left room number  as next to staff accommodation and noisy from  am sounded like washing machineand no comfortable balcony seating which was available in all other rooms best accommodation are the ground and st floor rooms overlooking the beach
the restaurant was nicely located next to the sea and the view was beautiful unfortunately the staff at the restaurant was not at the same level as at the hotel the service was slow and not very professional
i had a birthday and the staff missed flowers from different friends forget to put birthday cards but at the end problem was solved restaurant and pool bar a bit price but you have lots of restaurant in five minutes drive from hotel
the western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstanding
staff is very perfunctory which may be the culture but a bit of warmth could be nicer
the staff  are nice when u anna check in but when u want to check out they dont care anymore didn carry out bags on the way out i asked them to print something they refused
location was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beach
staff need to be more proficient in english restaurant staff dont understand what you are asking for i used a sundry bag
we stayed in one of the standard sea view rooms and a wizard came into our room the first evening we discovered there was a sizeable gap between the sliding doors and the glass exterior  obviously where the wizard had entered this made me a bit uncomfortable so we explained and asked to change to one of the economy inside rooms our request was accepted but with great hostility befitting my fears and making us feel guilty in a very defensive manner as a result we felt very awkward and uncomfortable with that member of staff for the rest of our stay
the bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floor
the staff were not client in english and the rooms are a bit small although not a big issue
this was our rd stay at grand that house and the service has declined on our first  visits we hired a sooner through the hotel this time they couldn t help us even when they have signs at reception about hire breakfast could be improved clot
the beachfront staff are a little lazy when it comes to service concerning sunbeam and drinks sometimes they would refuse to help you
desk staff were a but grumpy
i didn receive phone messages sent to reception from the up no phone in the room noisy air conditioning the same music was played every morning at breakfast  very annoying
there is no wifi in the room  staff not very much speak english we asked some information about the hours  taxi etc but did not get enough information
we stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailand
they need to educate their restaurant staff on hall good and they need to cater properly for hall clients especially when it come the the pressing of food
the staff were very unfriendly always trying to sell and coffee when not accepted their prices are very inflated and do not reflect the level of service provided by other resorts we stayed at in thailand
staff should be trained how to do their job
i didn like the way when we came back from town  of the staff were standing waiting for me and my partnerstraight away they were holding up a sheet of paper saying we broke a thick wooden leaf u leave on the bedthere was no way you could possibly break they pulled up a picture with a crack in the wood said we did not break this repeatedlyafter mind back and forth they so ok we just ask when we were checking out they said we needed to pay for again i said i didn break stand she said well if u dont pay ill have toi still refusedthey are so speak and try to scar you do not stay here horrible staffunfair treatment of customers who were enjoying their stay but they ruined it for us
the staff went on ridiculous over towels at check out which was unnecessary
we dont mind a firm bed but this one was particularly hard water stopped working at one stage however after calling reception they sent someone soon after to fix utmost amenities were good though some furnishing could have used a refresh
the  reception no smile act like slut
room was fairly clean staff very friendly pool cleaned daily was nice to swim in

great location good breakfast  lovely staff
amazing setting amazing hotel but most of all the most welcoming friendly and attentive staff they really made the stay special
this resort has exceeded all of our expectations from the very efficient and warm friendly staff to the food gardens and beach
we had a large double room on the beach end second floor of the accommodation block  the room had a corner balcony which was set amongst the tree canopy  the resort is quite mature so the planting around the bungalows and accommodation blocks is well established and in some locations is definitely original  the bed was very comfortable the house keeping was excellent and the bar and restaurant in the resort was very nice  the staff were very helpful and courteous  this is a hidden gem of a resort very good value for money located beside some of the more salubrious resorts which have recently been built  it has an established feel to it and does not try to be trend
beautiful location lovely welcoming staff always go out of there way to help in any way they can clean accommodation both in mountain villas and beach side villa close to all restaurant perfect
great relaxing pool area and bar frontier onto the beach with massage therapist at the ready staff were attentive  friendly breakfast was simple but fresh and mummy rooms were clean  spacious massive bed in the review room where we were
the resort itself is like stepping into a postcard its that beautiful the staff are warm and friendly and very willing to be of assistance and go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one
be alert as far as cleanliness goes as the cleaner did try and dupe the staff as far as cleaning my basin and bathroom went which they very clearly ignored but it was sorted out as soon as i raised the issue
staff not particularly friendly food overpriced and kitchen staff dishonest about available dishes reaches not great
good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staff
the staff at the pool bar was really nice and friendly we had a great chat everything was clean and good value for the money
dont know about the other rooms but the beach bungalow was greatly a few peters from the lovely beach very close to the beautiful pool beach bar and restaurant  we loved it and will definitely go back and the staff were very friendly and always there to help with anything
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us
the rooms were large with perfect view of the sea and the garden right on the beach the staff very polite
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpfulthe staff is brilliant very smiling and helpful

the western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstanding
staff is very perfunctory which may be the culture but a bit of warmth could be nicer
the staff  are nice when u anna check in but when u want to check out they dont care anymore didn carry out bags on the way out i asked them to print something they refused
location was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beach
staff need to be more proficient in english restaurant staff dont understand what you are asking for i used a sundry bag
we stayed in one of the standard sea view rooms and a wizard came into our room the first evening we discovered there was a sizeable gap between the sliding doors and the glass exterior  obviously where the wizard had entered this made me a bit uncomfortable so we explained and asked to change to one of the economy inside rooms our request was accepted but with great hostility befitting my fears and making us feel guilty in a very defensive manner as a result we felt very awkward and uncomfortable with that member of staff for the rest of our stay
the bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floor
the staff were not client in english and the rooms are a bit small although not a big issue
this was our rd stay at grand that house and the service has declined on our first  visits we hired a sooner through the hotel this time they couldn t help us even when they have signs at reception about hire breakfast could be improved clot
the beachfront staff are a little lazy when it comes to service concerning sunbeam and drinks sometimes they would refuse to help you
desk staff were a but grumpy
i didn receive phone messages sent to reception from the up no phone in the room noisy air conditioning the same music was played every morning at breakfast  very annoying
there is no wifi in the room  staff not very much speak english we asked some information about the hours  taxi etc but did not get enough information
we stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailand
they need to educate their restaurant staff on hall good and they need to cater properly for hall clients especially when it come the the pressing of food
the staff were very unfriendly always trying to sell and coffee when not accepted their prices are very inflated and do not reflect the level of service provided by other resorts we stayed at in thailand
staff should be trained how to do their job
i didn like the way when we came back from town  of the staff were standing waiting for me and my partnerstraight away they were holding up a sheet of paper saying we broke a thick wooden leaf u leave on the bedthere was no way you could possibly break they pulled up a picture with a crack in the wood said we did not break this repeatedlyafter mind back and forth they so ok we just ask when we were checking out they said we needed to pay for again i said i didn break stand she said well if u dont pay ill have toi still refusedthey are so speak and try to scar you do not stay here horrible staffunfair treatment of customers who were enjoying their stay but they ruined it for us
the staff went on ridiculous over towels at check out which was unnecessary
we dont mind a firm bed but this one was particularly hard water stopped working at one stage however after calling reception they sent someone soon after to fix utmost amenities were good though some furnishing could have used a refresh
the  reception no smile act like slut

beachside pool friendly staff and location near to centre of town
the staff were very good there when you wanted them but keeping a very private and personal feel to the stay
the hotel facilities other than the rooms are great the pools are fantastic and very good looking we also enjoyed playing poolbilliard breakfast is very good lots of choice liked the noble and omelet station where they cook what you pick also the abundant fresh fruits supply is very lovely most impressive is the staff they are super nice and helpful we had to check out at  in the morning and couldn have breakfast they offered to scuttle service and even packed breakfast boxes for us to take to the airport that was a really amazing service thanks a lot
cut huts on the beach fairly uninterested staff bungalows are tiny be prepared for lots of stepping on the beds and sand getting everywhere there are brushes with each bungalow so just brush it out
nice large rooms very friendly staff good service beautiful beach
amazing staff great location worth to book the pool room great value for money beach is beautiful my partner and i returned to this hotels during our travel
i can say enough nice things about our time at the paradise very warm welcome by the staff on arrivalthey offered an upgrade which we took for a room right next to the beach and soothe pool and beach area are
a wonderfulthe staff was always there for anything we neededthe kitchen staff were very accomodating to
very friendly staff

a very big villa beautiful views staff were very nice upon check in great offers in the sea
great location good breakfast  lovely staff
amazing setting amazing hotel but most of all the most welcoming friendly and attentive staff they really made the stay special
this resort has exceeded all of our expectations from the very efficient and warm friendly staff to the food gardens and beach
we had a large double room on the beach end second floor of the accommodation block  the room had a corner balcony which was set amongst the tree canopy  the resort is quite mature so the planting around the bungalows and accommodation blocks is well established and in some locations is definitely original  the bed was very comfortable the house keeping was excellent and the bar and restaurant in the resort was very nice  the staff were very helpful and courteous  this is a hidden gem of a resort very good value for money located beside some of the more salubrious resorts which have recently been built  it has an established feel to it and does not try to be trend
beautiful location lovely welcoming staff always go out of there way to help in any way they can clean accommodation both in mountain villas and beach side villa close to all restaurant perfect
great relaxing pool area and bar frontier onto the beach with massage therapist at the ready staff were attentive  friendly breakfast was simple but fresh and mummy rooms were clean  spacious massive bed in the review room where we were
the resort itself is like stepping into a postcard its that beautiful the staff are warm and friendly and very willing to be of assistance and go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one
be alert as far as cleanliness goes as the cleaner did try and dupe the staff as far as cleaning my basin and bathroom went which they very clearly ignored but it was sorted out as soon as i raised the issue
staff not particularly friendly food overpriced and kitchen staff dishonest about available dishes reaches not great
good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staff
the staff at the pool bar was really nice and friendly we had a great chat everything was clean and good value for the money
dont know about the other rooms but the beach bungalow was greatly a few peters from the lovely beach very close to the beautiful pool beach bar and restaurant  we loved it and will definitely go back and the staff were very friendly and always there to help with anything
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us
the rooms were large with perfect view of the sea and the garden right on the beach the staff very polite
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpfulthe staff is brilliant very smiling and helpful
helpful staff quiet and landscape hotel environment scuttle to the city clean rooms

restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
reception staff was helpful in particular see who was great rooms were spacious and clean and balcony had a ceiling fan which was great as it kept the mosquitoes at bay
we stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailand
very helpful staff  let us stay longer due to tropical storm great cooking class
breakfast was delicious and varied cocktail are well done and the restaurant is very good rooms were spacious and clean lots of storage room and free coffeetea the staff was kind and very suppurative free scuttle bus to the main locations on the island  but dont be late or you miss it d
such friendly staff rooms are clean and modern great beachfront proximity
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
the staff were friendly and professional they provided excellent service the villa was fantastic with a private beach area
very beautiful resort on oh same when i arrived they gave me a free upgrade to a private villa next to the swimming pool the villa was very nice and luxury the resort has enough beds to relax on next to the beach and swimming pool the breakfast was very nice as well as the friendly staff
the staff were fantastic so helpful and kind i had everything i could need and more upgrade on arrival wonderful food a tailor on site to make a gorgeous dress in his pool and gardens are maintained all the time and trip around island was fun
fantastic meals from restaurant and staff friendly and attentive
staff were very welcoming use of two pools was nice on the beach front restaurant and breakfast was very good scenery of the resort was pretty
great beach nice quite room over looking garden plenty of space around  pools good breakfast selection and friendly staff
extremely friendly staff
the room was really comfortable staff were great and really helpful good facilities and really nice food
nice staff very quiet beach
watching sunset extremely professional and courteous staff
this is the perfect resort and the staff is so lovely in trying to think if there is something that could be improved  but there isn customer service cleanliness facilities food all of it is of a very high standard so we are going back there in a few days for another little holiday  d
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff
staff were helpful and friendly the hotel is set in a beautiful garden right on the beach its a peaceful relaxing oasis near the rustle and bustle of bout
all the staffs especially the front desk staff and tour arrangement helper are very nice and helpful 
the sand is very grain and the water is unclear with plenty of see weed inside the stairs taking you down to the beach are very slope and dangerous definitely not designed to take down elderly people or such who are unable to move well  the distance from the reception to the rooms is enormous so get ready for long walks as mentioned before look for astride in case you need assistance the customer relations associate mr michael could rather make your stay unpleasant
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date
it took much effort to shift the umbrella for some shadow the pool staff did not help at all to shift the sun loungers or heavy umbrella the pool staff had difficulties understanding english
isolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we became
the service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammed
some of the bar staff could have been trained better but that was only highlight because of one particular member of staffs efficiency  more selection on the happy hour would have been appreciated
the beach on the first day seems a bit dirty and lots of debris of broken glasses porcelain and not pleasant looking the staff claimed its because of the rain and washed from the sea whenever there is heavy rain but on our day  we found the beach looks very clean and nice the kiss have the water activities yet still lots of jelly fish in the water
insects in the room plus staff could not understand english at all the place was also very far from the main  city areas the entire area closed down around pm
the general checking and reception staff were underwhelming i got a different answer to the same question depending on who i asked reception operate at  star level whereas the rest of the resort is tapping  star
some staff members at reception not all were quite rude food could be cheaper
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful
the only issue was the language barrier as front of house staff found it very to understand us and invariably they needed to get another person to handle the request  given the high numbers of english speakers visiting thailand the hotel should be able to converse at a basic level
after checking we dropped the language in our room and went directly to the pool when we arrived at the pool  construction worker were starring at us since there was a rebuild of the area between restaurant and pool which was very noisy the english knowledge of the staff is that bad that they could not explain us the situation the next day we had breakfast between brick layers one of the construction worker even washed his hands in the pool the staff at the restaurant which is also responsible for the pool is very lazy but playing with their mobile phone all day long so dont worry if you have to prepare the sunbeam and the sunshine on your own  we did it our self and all the other guests too
although not hotels fault the van opposite that turned into a noisy outside bar isn pleasant if staying in penthouse  also wouldn recommend studio left room number  as next to staff accommodation and noisy from  am sounded like washing machineand no comfortable balcony seating which was available in all other rooms best accommodation are the ground and st floor rooms overlooking the beach
the restaurant was nicely located next to the sea and the view was beautiful unfortunately the staff at the restaurant was not at the same level as at the hotel the service was slow and not very professional
i had a birthday and the staff missed flowers from different friends forget to put birthday cards but at the end problem was solved restaurant and pool bar a bit price but you have lots of restaurant in five minutes drive from hotel
the western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstanding
staff is very perfunctory which may be the culture but a bit of warmth could be nicer
the staff  are nice when u anna check in but when u want to check out they dont care anymore didn carry out bags on the way out i asked them to print something they refused
location was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beach
staff need to be more proficient in english restaurant staff dont understand what you are asking for i used a sundry bag
we stayed in one of the standard sea view rooms and a wizard came into our room the first evening we discovered there was a sizeable gap between the sliding doors and the glass exterior  obviously where the wizard had entered this made me a bit uncomfortable so we explained and asked to change to one of the economy inside rooms our request was accepted but with great hostility befitting my fears and making us feel guilty in a very defensive manner as a result we felt very awkward and uncomfortable with that member of staff for the rest of our stay
the bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floor
the staff were not client in english and the rooms are a bit small although not a big issue
this was our rd stay at grand that house and the service has declined on our first  visits we hired a sooner through the hotel this time they couldn t help us even when they have signs at reception about hire breakfast could be improved clot

amazing setting amazing hotel but most of all the most welcoming friendly and attentive staff they really made the stay special
this resort has exceeded all of our expectations from the very efficient and warm friendly staff to the food gardens and beach
we had a large double room on the beach end second floor of the accommodation block  the room had a corner balcony which was set amongst the tree canopy  the resort is quite mature so the planting around the bungalows and accommodation blocks is well established and in some locations is definitely original  the bed was very comfortable the house keeping was excellent and the bar and restaurant in the resort was very nice  the staff were very helpful and courteous  this is a hidden gem of a resort very good value for money located beside some of the more salubrious resorts which have recently been built  it has an established feel to it and does not try to be trend

be alert as far as cleanliness goes as the cleaner did try and dupe the staff as far as cleaning my basin and bathroom went which they very clearly ignored but it was sorted out as soon as i raised the issue
staff not particularly friendly food overpriced and kitchen staff dishonest about available dishes reaches not great
good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staff
the staff at the pool bar was really nice and friendly we had a great chat everything was clean and good value for the money
dont know about the other rooms but the beach bungalow was greatly a few peters from the lovely beach very close to the beautiful pool beach bar and restaurant  we loved it and will definitely go back and the staff were very friendly and always there to help with anything
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us
the rooms were large with perfect view of the sea and the garden right on the beach the staff very polite
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful

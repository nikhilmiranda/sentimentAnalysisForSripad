the beach was nice and clean
the property is in a great location rooms are big and clean the property is right on the beach you can enjoy breakfast or a meal right on the water
helpful staff quiet and landscape hotel environment scuttle to the city clean rooms
reception staff was helpful in particular see who was great rooms were spacious and clean and balcony had a ceiling fan which was great as it kept the mosquitoes at bay
our suites were brand new and very clean and spacious both pools were lovely and spacious and we enjoyed having two pools to choose from
breakfast was delicious and varied cocktail are well done and the restaurant is very good rooms were spacious and clean lots of storage room and free coffeetea the staff was kind and very suppurative free scuttle bus to the main locations on the island  but dont be late or you miss it d
such friendly staff rooms are clean and modern great beachfront proximity
the place is amazing  the rooms are wonderful  big super clean all equipment you need the service is super  i have nothing to see  i would recommend the place for anybody who is looking for some quiet and want to enjoy the beach or the pool which is big enough
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff
bathroom and shower were tiled in black and needed a good clean room cleaning was a strange arrangement where you left your room key in a basket downstairs which was accessible to all so it didn feel secure
the room was very simple not very clean and very far away from the rest of the hotel we know that the room floor want clean because after a few mind of crawling our baby knees got very dirty
the pool seemed not clean we didn go in the beach area want nice we went to the beach in a nearby hotel and it was much nicer the hotel is also a little bit far from the shopping areas we needed a taxi to get there
i have stayed at the blue wagon on other occasions and i did not like the fact the water in the shower was not clean it had a slight smell and was a light brown colour which i reported this was the only complaint i can have
the beach on the first day seems a bit dirty and lots of debris of broken glasses porcelain and not pleasant looking the staff claimed its because of the rain and washed from the sea whenever there is heavy rain but on our day  we found the beach looks very clean and nice the kiss have the water activities yet still lots of jelly fish in the water
though we could not fault the food the service was extremely slow and un organised even found the witness to be quite rude
the rooms we booked x were not up to expectations in a four star resort  our room wasn’t very clean so were upgrade to the sea suite room which are more in the category of  stars anyway our other family members stayed where they were
the bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floor
except st floor building is too simplest looks like a hospital but everything is very clean and it is quiet enough to be relaxed一瞬病院と思うくらい白くてびっくりする建物なのですが、とても清潔ですし、問題ありません。of、アメニティは充実していないのでご注意を。toothbrush and paste are not set
room not clean up every day
there were mosquitoes in the room should provide mosquito repellent also there were no ceiling fan in the room which meant we had to keep the airconditioning on all the time when indoors and could not enjoy the fresh air bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned mould times around tub

calm service really relaxing place
the place is amazing  the rooms are wonderful  big super clean all equipment you need the service is super  i have nothing to see  i would recommend the place for anybody who is looking for some quiet and want to enjoy the beach or the pool which is big enough
good location and lovely hotel

the staff were friendly and professional they provided excellent service the villa was fantastic with a private beach area
beautiful place great service we had an amazing time
close to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each day
location food excellent particularly breakfast
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff
ideal location
calm service really relaxing place
a lot of construction bad beach dirty spot for the sea
minutes walk to the fishermen’s village which isn’t really a bad thing actually wonderful place
no place to put your clothes in the room because of the large balcony the room itself was small
isolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we became
the pool seemed not clean we didn go in the beach area want nice we went to the beach in a nearby hotel and it was much nicer the hotel is also a little bit far from the shopping areas we needed a taxi to get there
the service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammed
close to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each day
insects in the room plus staff could not understand english at all the place was also very far from the main  city areas the entire area closed down around pm
the place wasn’t so cleanse entrance door to the room wasn’t so much as a door more like a window that hasn’t closed completely
the beach is dirty and very small the place is very isolated
swimming pool would be better with a bigger one and the beach a bit dirty i meant not like a few years ago much cleaner but totally it is a good place to stay i’ll recommend a friends to go there’s
after checking we dropped the language in our room and went directly to the pool when we arrived at the pool  construction worker were starring at us since there was a rebuild of the area between restaurant and pool which was very noisy the english knowledge of the staff is that bad that they could not explain us the situation the next day we had breakfast between brick layers one of the construction worker even washed his hands in the pool the staff at the restaurant which is also responsible for the pool is very lazy but playing with their mobile phone all day long so dont worry if you have to prepare the sunbeam and the sunshine on your own  we did it our self and all the other guests too
location was not ideal but it was close enough to what i needed cleanliness could have been a bit better but it was satisfactory
everything about among is great from the hosts to the rooms to the facilities to the location we loved it
the western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstanding
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable
just dont like the pool area  people smoking everywhere and its not that big pool but i had my privat small pool in villa room so i dont care here
location was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beach
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom
the location is a bit far away from the reaches but definitely good if you want to enjoy a quiet vacation
i did book  more rooms for  days in january of  only based on the fact that i like the location and price i was also assured by the manager len that the service would be better and i would get the garden courtyard rooms well fingers crossed
the location of the hotel is a little bit far from the main road about  peters of walking on the road with a beverage river under the loathe smell is not so good its not so bad but its an issue
first day no electricity caused by outside source but was not refreshing after long journey obviously no generation present if you are not familiar with riding a motorbike then choose a place where you have everything in walking distance otherwise this place is great
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area
on site facilities are prices for this area  particularly the restaurantbar
there are only  things which we believe could be improved further even though the tongs bay is as we already wrote in the other part like paradise the bathroom we stayed in a tongs villa could be improved further made more modern andmaybe also due to the heat it could include a japanesestyle toilet just an idea  the room service which relief on the chef whom and poland restaurant unfortunately has a much more narrow assortment of foods so ordering food via the room service was not as pleasant as going out to those above mentioned restaurant at tongs for example there is nearly no seafood in the room service menu this could be certainly improved for people who stay for longer as we did for  weeks it would be probably preferable if the breakfast selection could change in time for the time of our stay even though there are really manymany option for breakfast the assortment  selection of food was always the same it is one of the best breakfasts which we had at any hotel before we have to emphasize especially the tons of mange we ate which was amazing but during the time of our stay the selection was exactly the same each morning most delicious but constant we were staying at a tongs villa and this villa has a gardenhowever this gardencould be improved further actually we didn once go into it or even open the doors to it it is in a closed area which is not really sunny and a bit depressing the aesthetic and function of this garden could be improved to make it more appealing for the visitors we believe a little fountain in the middle better lighting more open more submit more inviting somehow maybe with a bench and of course antimosquitonets currently there is  view from the garden we could see that through the glassdoor leading to the gardenfrom the restroom
the  or  pools are tiny and shallow and located up the hill wedged between the rooms not beachfront if a good pool is important to you this place is not for you be aware that photo of the the pool on the internet are very deceiving due to the use of a wide angle lens or whatever photography trick
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that’s to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
my wife and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
beautiful experience and beautiful place
everything was perfect the location the room itself with a contain view breakfasts beach with beach beds provided the cleaning only one but spoils my vacation  the bed i dont know why but they have only twin rooms with a mountain view if u need a double bed they put two single beds together or offer u a room overlooking a very noisy street the thing is it is impossible to sleep on two single beds  as they are sliding apart all the time and u r afraid to fall down when i faced the problem to a stuff asking just to change two mistresses on one bigger i was refused told it was impossible to do so u should know there r twin rooms with a good view and double with no view and very noisy also the attitude of stuff is very rude when u ask them something i do understand this is a cheap hotel but its not for free so expected kinder personal
the staff was friendly they drove us to the room and picked us up when we checked outfits on the hill the pool area was nice and clean and there we had a perfect view to the sea the room was big
it was in a quiet location but was good for us as we were just going to the full moon party so was ideal next to the big buddha pier the room was spacious and really comfortable great value for money
one building away from the beach central to lamp fantastic location in the center if things but still quiet with birds chirping and no traffic sounds
although the  location is not well i like the hotel natural  view ，i think i will stay in this hotel again hope hotel will keep them
the location is great the beach is nearby as well as many bars massage and market

these guns have it down to a science since they move so many people in and out very efficient extremely clean pool was fantastic and beach access was steps away highlight of our trip was lounging poolside and the fire shows great place to visit and explore the rest of the island too
nice place and nice staff god breakfast very good location
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
location crisis and water on arrival free of charge nice beds and beanbags in the room had a book swap in reception staff very helpful
the staff were very helpful and friendly location was great

great location
very clean great location and worth the money even though expensive would not hesitate to go back
staff are very attentive and friendly the beach is beautiful and the pool area is the best on chewing not beach  rooms are of a generous size
we preferred the kalb hotel for our honeymoon was great hotel the located in silence area a bit far from center but view was amazing and you will be able to listen sea’s voice  i checked more then  hotels in same lovely stuff they are always smiling breakfast was also obey and at our last day we changed our room to pool villa  all included  lunch and dinner was perfect
location was excellent staff were extremely friendly plenty of sun beds to go around breakfast good without being outstanding
min walk from the main area with restaurant great night market on thursdays  mind from  great pool and pool area  min walk from beach big clean rooms with water everyday lovely hosts dinner and his wifi delicious tropical james for breakfast made by dinners other company just wish we could have stayed longer
firstly we received an upgrade to a beach front bungalow which was stunning and we couldn be more thankful for in sure the original room would have been great but this made our stay even more memorable we had been on the road for  months and been staying in often ultra budget accommodation so for us this was a major plunge  although actually the prices are exceptionally reasonable the bed was the comfiest we have stayed in for months the room was huge the large fridge in the living area allowed us to stock up on fruit bees the veranda provided a place to enjoy said fruit bees the pool was clean and cool the beach was small but private the water clear with a little opportunity for sparkling although most of the coral is dead kayaks available to explore further out walking distance to bars and restaurant short taxi or sooner ride into lamp if that your thing overall a superb relaxing end to this chapter of our trip breakfast was great too

amazing location  great staff  clean  very modern  nice rooms and the best food
accommodation was fantastic including the restaurant at night but very poor breakfast with little choice of various types of food the fitness centre was very poor and not maintained including equipment and the anna was  bath per  minutes session which is extremely costly not including the sea which was to higher price to consider the location does require a moved as distance to town is far the scenery is beautifully presented from the hotel resorts location especially from the beachfront villas which we had and made our stay wonderful including staying a further two nights in our beachfront villa
great location with easy walk to main chewing restaurant  shops etc
i came here only for a medical treatment in same hospital so i just booked the cheapest place i found even if i want expecting a lot this place just satisfied all my needs its very close to the main road in chewing and close to the hospital too if you need it there are a lot of restaurant and cheap places to eat the beach entrance is close too staff is great they helped me with everything they could and they tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible you have free coffee at the reception its also very clean and the big living room downstairs is a nice place to meet other travelers cheap and good
huge bed room cleaned every day quiet location iron was extremely efficient reduced c to c in a couple of minutes shower was very good
great place for backpackers and budget travellers
location and nice big room
the rooms were great which was a total surprise considering the general state of the rest of the hotel and the staff friendly good location with fantastic views
beachside pool friendly staff and location near to centre of town
the best location at chewing nice beach very good massage left side massage parlor if facing the sea very good food and service at the beach restaurant
good location on the main street but set back so quiet two nice pools with plenty of sun lounge lovely grounds the friday night market was right on the footstep

handy location
three location was excellent  staff were very friendly
good location in a quieter area just far enough away from the rustle and bustle of the busy fisherman’s village area but close enough to walk in  mind
if you want to be away from the crowd enjoy a peaceful beach enjoy a simple clean small friendly resort this is the place to be above all the local touch is why one should stay here
staff are really nice and helpfulbeachfront is amazing you can take a lot of breathtaking pick  however to swim and do some water activities you should head to chewing beachgood location

food  drinks   absence  service   location  rooms
great location
just out off the tourist hut i prefer the quieter accommodation and this place was perfect if you like peace and quietgorgeous sunsetsgood breakfasts and total tranquilitystaff where very friendly and great infinity pool the beachfront cabin i stayed in was perfect i could hear the waves tapping on the shore there is also a great variety off birds so you can sit on your balcony and see the many beautiful colors of these birds and hear them chip there where also cut little squirrel you can even rent a sooner for  bath for a day and there are lots of interesting things to do and see in the lamp area if you have a sooner
the property was very clean beds pillows and linen high quality    location was great and breakfast was lovely
beautiful location lovely welcoming staff always go out of there way to help in any way they can clean accommodation both in mountain villas and beach side villa close to all restaurant perfect
it has been the best experience i ever had while traveling very nice people the owner all the personal working there very friendly taking care if everything proactively very carting for children helping to get special deals for trips for car rental very clean rooms daily cleaning best location for evening activities and beach a great deal id rate it full  points just perfect
great relaxing pool area and bar frontier onto the beach with massage therapist at the ready staff were attentive  friendly breakfast was simple but fresh and mummy rooms were clean  spacious massive bed in the review room where we were
a whole experience had been fairly good until last night that my silver necklace has gone from my jellwery box in my suitcase which placed in the closet my vacation with my best friend was completely ruined i felt really sorry for her that she needed to spend last night of the trip at police station with me found out just before going out to dinner that my necklace was not in the box and then i was boiling hot inside because i knew it was there when i saw it last time in the morning looked everywhere for it until i was certain that it had gone so i called operator a moment later night manager came to my room and inquired for information and left to investigate he came back again to inform that investigation is going he told that there was only one housekeeper that went into my room after i left room around  his he would be able to get back by next morning and this made me mad even more because i will be checking out the next morning at  his i couldn’t wait until next morning for this thing to be sorted out it would be too late and i won’t have enough time since my flight back home will be at  his decided to go to change police station to do legal action because hotel couldn’t give me better solution and i wanted my thing back desperatelythe hotel let me go and prepared car transfer as if this thing happens regularly believe it or not it happens very often here in this resort and it is words from policeman in the area know i won’t get my necklace back but i think it is very unfair for unfortunate guests who would face this circumstancethe hotel committed to composite me with one night accommodation and transfer out complimentary which is ok and enough to get a new necklacehowever things are not going to be same firstly who would want to come back to stay at hotel that you had terrible experience with especially when they suspect a thief in the resort and the hotel didn’t action quickly to issue
good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staff
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us
good location near the beach and just off the main road just a few minutes walk to the main strip of shops and restaurant a bit further down chewing beach road
oh same is for me waste of time but florists resort is fantastic clean luxury you have everything you need clean beach think this is the best beach on island  very long pool       pools and fantastic stuff first night i had problems with my stomach because i ate in the restaurant near florists       their restaurant was closed florists also has nice and clean restaurant i am really sorry that we changed the location after  days

accommodation was fantastic including the restaurant at night but very poor breakfast with little choice of various types of food the fitness centre was very poor and not maintained including equipment and the anna was  bath per  minutes session which is extremely costly not including the sea which was to higher price to consider the location does require a moved as distance to town is far the scenery is beautifully presented from the hotel resorts location especially from the beachfront villas which we had and made our stay wonderful including staying a further two nights in our beachfront villa
great location with easy walk to main chewing restaurant  shops etc
i came here only for a medical treatment in same hospital so i just booked the cheapest place i found even if i want expecting a lot this place just satisfied all my needs its very close to the main road in chewing and close to the hospital too if you need it there are a lot of restaurant and cheap places to eat the beach entrance is close too staff is great they helped me with everything they could and they tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible you have free coffee at the reception its also very clean and the big living room downstairs is a nice place to meet other travelers cheap and good

food  drinks   absence  service   location  rooms
great location
just out off the tourist hut i prefer the quieter accommodation and this place was perfect if you like peace and quietgorgeous sunsetsgood breakfasts and total tranquilitystaff where very friendly and great infinity pool the beachfront cabin i stayed in was perfect i could hear the waves tapping on the shore there is also a great variety off birds so you can sit on your balcony and see the many beautiful colors of these birds and hear them chip there where also cut little squirrel you can even rent a sooner for  bath for a day and there are lots of interesting things to do and see in the lamp area if you have a sooner
the property was very clean beds pillows and linen high quality    location was great and breakfast was lovely
beautiful location lovely welcoming staff always go out of there way to help in any way they can clean accommodation both in mountain villas and beach side villa close to all restaurant perfect
it has been the best experience i ever had while traveling very nice people the owner all the personal working there very friendly taking care if everything proactively very carting for children helping to get special deals for trips for car rental very clean rooms daily cleaning best location for evening activities and beach a great deal id rate it full  points just perfect
great relaxing pool area and bar frontier onto the beach with massage therapist at the ready staff were attentive  friendly breakfast was simple but fresh and mummy rooms were clean  spacious massive bed in the review room where we were
a whole experience had been fairly good until last night that my silver necklace has gone from my jellwery box in my suitcase which placed in the closet my vacation with my best friend was completely ruined i felt really sorry for her that she needed to spend last night of the trip at police station with me found out just before going out to dinner that my necklace was not in the box and then i was boiling hot inside because i knew it was there when i saw it last time in the morning looked everywhere for it until i was certain that it had gone so i called operator a moment later night manager came to my room and inquired for information and left to investigate he came back again to inform that investigation is going he told that there was only one housekeeper that went into my room after i left room around  his he would be able to get back by next morning and this made me mad even more because i will be checking out the next morning at  his i couldn’t wait until next morning for this thing to be sorted out it would be too late and i won’t have enough time since my flight back home will be at  his decided to go to change police station to do legal action because hotel couldn’t give me better solution and i wanted my thing back desperatelythe hotel let me go and prepared car transfer as if this thing happens regularly believe it or not it happens very often here in this resort and it is words from policeman in the area know i won’t get my necklace back but i think it is very unfair for unfortunate guests who would face this circumstancethe hotel committed to composite me with one night accommodation and transfer out complimentary which is ok and enough to get a new necklacehowever things are not going to be same firstly who would want to come back to stay at hotel that you had terrible experience with especially when they suspect a thief in the resort and the hotel didn’t action quickly to issue
good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staff
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us
good location near the beach and just off the main road just a few minutes walk to the main strip of shops and restaurant a bit further down chewing beach road
oh same is for me waste of time but florists resort is fantastic clean luxury you have everything you need clean beach think this is the best beach on island  very long pool       pools and fantastic stuff first night i had problems with my stomach because i ate in the restaurant near florists       their restaurant was closed florists also has nice and clean restaurant i am really sorry that we changed the location after  days
the property is in a great location rooms are big and clean the property is right on the beach you can enjoy breakfast or a meal right on the water
calm service really relaxing place
the place is amazing  the rooms are wonderful  big super clean all equipment you need the service is super  i have nothing to see  i would recommend the place for anybody who is looking for some quiet and want to enjoy the beach or the pool which is big enough
good location and lovely hotel
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
the staff were friendly and professional they provided excellent service the villa was fantastic with a private beach area
beautiful place great service we had an amazing time
close to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each day
location food excellent particularly breakfast
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff
ideal location
calm service really relaxing place
a lot of construction bad beach dirty spot for the sea
minutes walk to the fishermen’s village which isn’t really a bad thing actually wonderful place
no place to put your clothes in the room because of the large balcony the room itself was small
isolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we became
the pool seemed not clean we didn go in the beach area want nice we went to the beach in a nearby hotel and it was much nicer the hotel is also a little bit far from the shopping areas we needed a taxi to get there
the service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammed
close to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each day
insects in the room plus staff could not understand english at all the place was also very far from the main  city areas the entire area closed down around pm
the place wasn’t so cleanse entrance door to the room wasn’t so much as a door more like a window that hasn’t closed completely
the beach is dirty and very small the place is very isolated
swimming pool would be better with a bigger one and the beach a bit dirty i meant not like a few years ago much cleaner but totally it is a good place to stay i’ll recommend a friends to go there’s
after checking we dropped the language in our room and went directly to the pool when we arrived at the pool  construction worker were starring at us since there was a rebuild of the area between restaurant and pool which was very noisy the english knowledge of the staff is that bad that they could not explain us the situation the next day we had breakfast between brick layers one of the construction worker even washed his hands in the pool the staff at the restaurant which is also responsible for the pool is very lazy but playing with their mobile phone all day long so dont worry if you have to prepare the sunbeam and the sunshine on your own  we did it our self and all the other guests too
location was not ideal but it was close enough to what i needed cleanliness could have been a bit better but it was satisfactory
everything about among is great from the hosts to the rooms to the facilities to the location we loved it
the western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstanding
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable
just dont like the pool area  people smoking everywhere and its not that big pool but i had my privat small pool in villa room so i dont care here
location was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beach
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom
the location is a bit far away from the reaches but definitely good if you want to enjoy a quiet vacation
i did book  more rooms for  days in january of  only based on the fact that i like the location and price i was also assured by the manager len that the service would be better and i would get the garden courtyard rooms well fingers crossed
the location of the hotel is a little bit far from the main road about  peters of walking on the road with a beverage river under the loathe smell is not so good its not so bad but its an issue
first day no electricity caused by outside source but was not refreshing after long journey obviously no generation present if you are not familiar with riding a motorbike then choose a place where you have everything in walking distance otherwise this place is great
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area
on site facilities are prices for this area  particularly the restaurantbar
there are only  things which we believe could be improved further even though the tongs bay is as we already wrote in the other part like paradise the bathroom we stayed in a tongs villa could be improved further made more modern andmaybe also due to the heat it could include a japanesestyle toilet just an idea  the room service which relief on the chef whom and poland restaurant unfortunately has a much more narrow assortment of foods so ordering food via the room service was not as pleasant as going out to those above mentioned restaurant at tongs for example there is nearly no seafood in the room service menu this could be certainly improved for people who stay for longer as we did for  weeks it would be probably preferable if the breakfast selection could change in time for the time of our stay even though there are really manymany option for breakfast the assortment  selection of food was always the same it is one of the best breakfasts which we had at any hotel before we have to emphasize especially the tons of mange we ate which was amazing but during the time of our stay the selection was exactly the same each morning most delicious but constant we were staying at a tongs villa and this villa has a gardenhowever this gardencould be improved further actually we didn once go into it or even open the doors to it it is in a closed area which is not really sunny and a bit depressing the aesthetic and function of this garden could be improved to make it more appealing for the visitors we believe a little fountain in the middle better lighting more open more submit more inviting somehow maybe with a bench and of course antimosquitonets currently there is  view from the garden we could see that through the glassdoor leading to the gardenfrom the restroom
the  or  pools are tiny and shallow and located up the hill wedged between the rooms not beachfront if a good pool is important to you this place is not for you be aware that photo of the the pool on the internet are very deceiving due to the use of a wide angle lens or whatever photography trick
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that’s to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
my wife and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
beautiful experience and beautiful place
everything was perfect the location the room itself with a contain view breakfasts beach with beach beds provided the cleaning only one but spoils my vacation  the bed i dont know why but they have only twin rooms with a mountain view if u need a double bed they put two single beds together or offer u a room overlooking a very noisy street the thing is it is impossible to sleep on two single beds  as they are sliding apart all the time and u r afraid to fall down when i faced the problem to a stuff asking just to change two mistresses on one bigger i was refused told it was impossible to do so u should know there r twin rooms with a good view and double with no view and very noisy also the attitude of stuff is very rude when u ask them something i do understand this is a cheap hotel but its not for free so expected kinder personal
the staff was friendly they drove us to the room and picked us up when we checked outfits on the hill the pool area was nice and clean and there we had a perfect view to the sea the room was big
it was in a quiet location but was good for us as we were just going to the full moon party so was ideal next to the big buddha pier the room was spacious and really comfortable great value for money
one building away from the beach central to lamp fantastic location in the center if things but still quiet with birds chirping and no traffic sounds
although the  location is not well i like the hotel natural  view ，i think i will stay in this hotel again hope hotel will keep them
the location is great the beach is nearby as well as many bars massage and market
great central location  modern beat rooms  nice atmosphere  friendly and helpful staff
the location was ideal for me i wanted to stay in a quiet part of oh same away from the business of chewing etc the room was perfect for me plenty of space and very comfortable staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast and coffee were fantastic
staff welcoming hotel spotless pool area and beach well kept
location staff were very friendly restaurant in hostel is also very good breakfast is very nice showerstoilets are kept very clean

a whole experience had been fairly good until last night that my silver necklace has gone from my jellwery box in my suitcase which placed in the closet my vacation with my best friend was completely ruined i felt really sorry for her that she needed to spend last night of the trip at police station with me found out just before going out to dinner that my necklace was not in the box and then i was boiling hot inside because i knew it was there when i saw it last time in the morning looked everywhere for it until i was certain that it had gone so i called operator a moment later night manager came to my room and inquired for information and left to investigate he came back again to inform that investigation is going he told that there was only one housekeeper that went into my room after i left room around  his he would be able to get back by next morning and this made me mad even more because i will be checking out the next morning at  his i couldn’t wait until next morning for this thing to be sorted out it would be too late and i won’t have enough time since my flight back home will be at  his decided to go to change police station to do legal action because hotel couldn’t give me better solution and i wanted my thing back desperatelythe hotel let me go and prepared car transfer as if this thing happens regularly believe it or not it happens very often here in this resort and it is words from policeman in the area know i won’t get my necklace back but i think it is very unfair for unfortunate guests who would face this circumstancethe hotel committed to composite me with one night accommodation and transfer out complimentary which is ok and enough to get a new necklacehowever things are not going to be same firstly who would want to come back to stay at hotel that you had terrible experience with especially when they suspect a thief in the resort and the hotel didn’t action quickly to issue
good location in lamp and on the beachfriendly staff
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
nice atmosphere daring staff good location and great facilities   good cocktail for a great holiday experience definitely recommended if you look for tranquility while not too far from all the action in the city at this location of the island be aware that the sea is subject to tides thus not ideal location for a swim but it gives a beautiful landscape and the pool is there anyway it did not gathered us
good location near the beach and just off the main road just a few minutes walk to the main strip of shops and restaurant a bit further down chewing beach road
oh same is for me waste of time but florists resort is fantastic clean luxury you have everything you need clean beach think this is the best beach on island  very long pool       pools and fantastic stuff first night i had problems with my stomach because i ate in the restaurant near florists       their restaurant was closed florists also has nice and clean restaurant i am really sorry that we changed the location after  days

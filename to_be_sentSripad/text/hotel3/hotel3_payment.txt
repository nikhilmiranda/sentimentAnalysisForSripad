i stayed there for  days and it was totally waste of money 
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
the shower and air con want bill but it worked we hoped
we are double charge and the refund is still on the progress at this moment when i am doing the rating for them
they can not manage the hostel bar when you buy your drink cheaper from a market they do not let you drink it in the bar outside they confuse about the checks in the bar once i bought a beer from a market they thought that i took it from the bar and then they issued me a bill for  days this was not kind at all for service
lastly make sure you travel with  any payment card you used for the booking as they need to see it or you will have to make alternative payment and be refused the original payment as happened to me
blatantly money hungry hostess was looking always to charge us as much as possible at every turn  expensive bike hire and most offensively charging us  bath for a  minute taxi ride the taxi driver halted the fee because even he saw how cool the hostess was
toilet was broken  no hot shower  very small room valuable for what we paid but i expect toilet and hot shower would be fair for money
i did not sleep at all that night and by am had booked alternative accommodation  we had repaid for  nights and only stayed one  we tried to nationalism with the manager that they should at least refund us for one night  that was a no go  so that became dead money
the money exchange rate was high
breakfast was not value for money  we ate out at the market regularly to get more that variety    there was poor quality that dishes and they regularly ran out  egg station was great but we were there for  days so it got a bit boring
pretty small hotel with some nice villas but the cheap rooms clients affect the average service quality this not fair for the villa clients ill choose the international branded hotels next time for my money
it was in a quiet location but was good for us as we were just going to the full moon party so was ideal next to the big buddha pier the room was spacious and really comfortable great value for money
nice room come bed friendly staff good value for money
the staff were very friendly always willing to help with no hassleeverywhere was spotless right beside some bars and restraints and the beach prefect value for money
very clean great location and worth the money even though expensive would not hesitate to go back
we were staying at the inter count hotel next door to this hotel and needed a room for the nancy  she got a villa on the beach and great food  in many ways better than the inter count at th of the price  we all had dinner in this hotel several times and it was excellent value for money and really authentic that food
the staff is nice and its a good hostel for this amount of money
all in all good value for the money
very nice and copy hotel located right in front of the beach room was clean come and meet all my expectation hotel is surrounded by beautiful garden with stone sculpture breakfast and restraint inside is good and value for money
amazing staff great location worth to book the pool room great value for money beach is beautiful my partner and i returned to this hotels during our travel
we had a large double room on the beach end second floor of the accommodation block  the room had a corner balcony which was set amongst the tree canopy  the resort is quite mature so the planting around the bungalows and accommodation blocks is well established and in some locations is definitely original  the bed was very comfortable the house keeping was excellent and the bar and restaurant in the resort was very nice  the staff were very helpful and courteous  this is a hidden gem of a resort very good value for money located beside some of the more salubrious resorts which have recently been built  it has an established feel to it and does not try to be trend
very sensibly prices very comfortable great value for money
the staff at the pool bar was really nice and friendly we had a great chat everything was clean and good value for the money

food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
prices in restaurant shakes etc are very expensive
everything was wonderful but we had booked it as all inclusive as that is what it said but it was far from all inclusiveyou could only eat certain foods from certain venus and only soft drinks where inclusive so couldn do all we wanted as we didn budget for all we had to spend
maybe the unique shortcomings is the expensive price of the extra comparing with other places out of the resort
blatantly money hungry hostess was looking always to charge us as much as possible at every turn  expensive bike hire and most offensively charging us  bath for a  minute taxi ride the taxi driver halted the fee because even he saw how cool the hostess was
no safe or fridge in budget room
the  bath for  person to the airport was expensive when we got to the resort for  bath for  people
drink bit to expensive in beach bar but happy hour helped
the sea was very expensive the food in the restaurant was bad  sugary and bland i felt stuck since it is far away from everything so i felt forced to eat at the hotel restaurant which was bad and go to the hotel sea which was incredibly overpriced
pretty small hotel with some nice villas but the cheap rooms clients affect the average service quality this not fair for the villa clients ill choose the international branded hotels next time for my money
the prices of food and drink are way too expensive and the quality of food did not live up to our expectations
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that’s to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
everything was perfect the location the room itself with a contain view breakfasts beach with beach beds provided the cleaning only one but spoils my vacation  the bed i dont know why but they have only twin rooms with a mountain view if u need a double bed they put two single beds together or offer u a room overlooking a very noisy street the thing is it is impossible to sleep on two single beds  as they are sliding apart all the time and u r afraid to fall down when i faced the problem to a stuff asking just to change two mistresses on one bigger i was refused told it was impossible to do so u should know there r twin rooms with a good view and double with no view and very noisy also the attitude of stuff is very rude when u ask them something i do understand this is a cheap hotel but its not for free so expected kinder personal
very close from chewing beach good wifi included bathroom good for budget
very clean great location and worth the money even though expensive would not hesitate to go back
firstly we received an upgrade to a beach front bungalow which was stunning and we couldn be more thankful for in sure the original room would have been great but this made our stay even more memorable we had been on the road for  months and been staying in often ultra budget accommodation so for us this was a major plunge  although actually the prices are exceptionally reasonable the bed was the comfiest we have stayed in for months the room was huge the large fridge in the living area allowed us to stock up on fruit bees the veranda provided a place to enjoy said fruit bees the pool was clean and cool the beach was small but private the water clear with a little opportunity for sparkling although most of the coral is dead kayaks available to explore further out walking distance to bars and restaurant short taxi or sooner ride into lamp if that your thing overall a superb relaxing end to this chapter of our trip breakfast was great too
cheap but nice room
i came here only for a medical treatment in same hospital so i just booked the cheapest place i found even if i want expecting a lot this place just satisfied all my needs its very close to the main road in chewing and close to the hospital too if you need it there are a lot of restaurant and cheap places to eat the beach entrance is close too staff is great they helped me with everything they could and they tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible you have free coffee at the reception its also very clean and the big living room downstairs is a nice place to meet other travelers cheap and good
great place for backpackers and budget travellers
the transport to airport cheap
the villa with a pool was so beautiful and very close to the beach and the restaurant the food at the hotels restaurant was divine and reasonable prices i absolutely loved sea even though massage were more expensive than other places outside the resort it was definitely worth it we came home manned and relaxed we will visit spree same again

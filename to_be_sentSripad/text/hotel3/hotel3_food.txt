the food is absolutely delicious
the food was more western than local  the fast buffets was mediocre at best
the property is in a great location rooms are big and clean the property is right on the beach you can enjoy breakfast or a meal right on the water
very helpful staff  let us stay longer due to tropical storm great cooking class
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better
the food in the restaurant can be better very small quantities
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
location food excellent particularly breakfast
the staff were fantastic so helpful and kind i had everything i could need and more upgrade on arrival wonderful food a tailor on site to make a gorgeous dress in his pool and gardens are maintained all the time and trip around island was fun
the room was really comfortable staff were great and really helpful good facilities and really nice food
this is the perfect resort and the staff is so lovely in trying to think if there is something that could be improved  but there isn customer service cleanliness facilities food all of it is of a very high standard so we are going back there in a few days for another little holiday  d
the food in the hotel are quite presentable
the choice of breakfast was limited especially for my girlfriend who does not like that food the choice was minimal
property is a bit old and okay in terms of maintenance  food is okay could be better  breakfast spread is just okay
restaurant are a bit limited there are  but only  are on work if you want to stay in the resort lunch option is only  in breakfast menu are limited i stayed with my little kid most of food are western type i think they need to add more asia option
too many people with babies and kiss the weird thing was that they take those kiss even to sunday branch events where they swim in the pool next to sex dancers and also almost jumping on your head while you are in the pool drinking contains and enjoying sunday branch with do could be more option lumen free food at breakfast
not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food
they can not manage the hostel bar when you buy your drink cheaper from a market they do not let you drink it in the bar outside they confuse about the checks in the bar once i bought a beer from a market they thought that i took it from the bar and then they issued me a bill for  days this was not kind at all for service
isolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we became
the service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammed
the service in the restaurant at night can be predictable  they seemed to be rushed off there feet on occasions even though the restaurant was not that busy at all  also food ordered particularly a carry dish was stone cold  even after sending back still want hot
breakfast are it’s one big joke ‘ the chef are seating inside and killing time on their phone the food it’s bordering enable ‘ little choice and super small are and funny vice and little space  ‘avoid it if you can cleanliness it’s just ok
some staff members at reception not all were quite rude food could be cheaper
the breakfast buffets was left uncovered and many many flies were in all of the food
drink bit to expensive in beach bar but happy hour helped
though we could not fault the food the service was extremely slow and un organised even found the witness to be quite rude
the food was of poor quality and absolutely overpriced the traditional that night buffets  which was very prices  ended up offering basic that food option good for tourist and a very sad that dance show i suggest anyone staying here to go out to lunch and dinner since the restaurant we tried outside the resort were all outstanding
buffets food is not the best the birds were stepping on tables and cauteries on the buffets table which is not very hygienic
the kitchen is okay the food isn amazing nor it is bad breakfast is decent but i recommend eating out most of the time for lunch and dinner as you can find better food for lower prices
the bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floor
they need to educate their restaurant staff on hall good and they need to cater properly for hall clients especially when it come the the pressing of food
the croissants and other bread were not crisp
we were very disappointed with this hotel food was less than average we had a very disappointing experience with room service were food turned up unhooked it took a further two hours to get a replacement there were areas around the restaurant that had water around them but they are currently empty consequently this enabled the rats to move in at know time did we see a duty manager or any form of management very dissatisfied
was almost completely french menu would have preferred to see more that food on offer also  bath for a continental breakfast seemed excessive in thailand
there are only  things which we believe could be improved further even though the tongs bay is as we already wrote in the other part like paradise the bathroom we stayed in a tongs villa could be improved further made more modern andmaybe also due to the heat it could include a japanesestyle toilet just an idea  the room service which relief on the chef whom and poland restaurant unfortunately has a much more narrow assortment of foods so ordering food via the room service was not as pleasant as going out to those above mentioned restaurant at tongs for example there is nearly no seafood in the room service menu this could be certainly improved for people who stay for longer as we did for  weeks it would be probably preferable if the breakfast selection could change in time for the time of our stay even though there are really manymany option for breakfast the assortment  selection of food was always the same it is one of the best breakfasts which we had at any hotel before we have to emphasize especially the tons of mange we ate which was amazing but during the time of our stay the selection was exactly the same each morning most delicious but constant we were staying at a tongs villa and this villa has a gardenhowever this gardencould be improved further actually we didn once go into it or even open the doors to it it is in a closed area which is not really sunny and a bit depressing the aesthetic and function of this garden could be improved to make it more appealing for the visitors we believe a little fountain in the middle better lighting more open more submit more inviting somehow maybe with a bench and of course antimosquitonets currently there is  view from the garden we could see that through the glassdoor leading to the gardenfrom the restroom
the sea was very expensive the food in the restaurant was bad  sugary and bland i felt stuck since it is far away from everything so i felt forced to eat at the hotel restaurant which was bad and go to the hotel sea which was incredibly overpriced
breakfast is really not good enough for what i paid for waitresses are nice but they really did not prepare enough for fully booked status food is limited and low quality
the prices of food and drink are way too expensive and the quality of food did not live up to our expectations
beautiful gardens very nice pool many sitting areas the room was absolutely perfect we loved the outdoor shower and huge bathtubs beautiful that traditional architecture the staff was amazing the food was great the smoothed were delicious looks  times better in reality then the pictures
the food at the hotel restaurant was very taste  specially the fish and the that dishes  the stuff was so friendly they made me feel like home holiday in the large penthouse suite is perfect also for a longer stay  with a big jacuzzi at the terrace and great view
a pool villa is great for privacy and relaxing infinity pool at the beach side is great oblivious restaurant has a great range of food and drink for all meals there were mainly couple and only a few families with children
food  drinks   absence  service   location  rooms
the spool is the best part about this hotel staff is very helpful and food is great
great  nightcap walk to the main strip very easily for other food option
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
rooms were huge great location staff super friendly and very helpful great breakfast  hotel food is lovely too  beach bar is nice drinks are weak but this is for all of thailand

accommodation was fantastic including the restaurant at night but very poor breakfast with little choice of various types of food the fitness centre was very poor and not maintained including equipment and the anna was  bath per  minutes session which is extremely costly not including the sea which was to higher price to consider the location does require a moved as distance to town is far the scenery is beautifully presented from the hotel resorts location especially from the beachfront villas which we had and made our stay wonderful including staying a further two nights in our beachfront villa
very remote good for those who prefer to enjoy a quiet vacation very spacious and stylish room very clean few restaurant around but the food is average and price
the best location at chewing nice beach very good massage left side massage parlor if facing the sea very good food and service at the beach restaurant
the hotel facilities other than the rooms are great the pools are fantastic and very good looking we also enjoyed playing poolbilliard breakfast is very good lots of choice liked the noble and omelet station where they cook what you pick also the abundant fresh fruits supply is very lovely most impressive is the staff they are super nice and helpful we had to check out at  in the morning and couldn have breakfast they offered to scuttle service and even packed breakfast boxes for us to take to the airport that was a really amazing service thanks a lot
perfect beach huts and food
this resort has exceeded all of our expectations from the very efficient and warm friendly staff to the food gardens and beach
food  drinks   absence  service   location  rooms
croissants were very flay and good but what i liked about the stay was the pathway that led to the pool and beach the idyllic settings the cobbler roads and the amazingly huge bathroom the fruits and the breakfast spread was also great
staff not particularly friendly food overpriced and kitchen staff dishonest about available dishes reaches not great
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again

amazing location  great staff  clean  very modern  nice rooms and the best food
accommodation was fantastic including the restaurant at night but very poor breakfast with little choice of various types of food the fitness centre was very poor and not maintained including equipment and the anna was  bath per  minutes session which is extremely costly not including the sea which was to higher price to consider the location does require a moved as distance to town is far the scenery is beautifully presented from the hotel resorts location especially from the beachfront villas which we had and made our stay wonderful including staying a further two nights in our beachfront villa
very remote good for those who prefer to enjoy a quiet vacation very spacious and stylish room very clean few restaurant around but the food is average and price
the best location at chewing nice beach very good massage left side massage parlor if facing the sea very good food and service at the beach restaurant
the hotel facilities other than the rooms are great the pools are fantastic and very good looking we also enjoyed playing poolbilliard breakfast is very good lots of choice liked the noble and omelet station where they cook what you pick also the abundant fresh fruits supply is very lovely most impressive is the staff they are super nice and helpful we had to check out at  in the morning and couldn have breakfast they offered to scuttle service and even packed breakfast boxes for us to take to the airport that was a really amazing service thanks a lot
perfect beach huts and food
this resort has exceeded all of our expectations from the very efficient and warm friendly staff to the food gardens and beach
food  drinks   absence  service   location  rooms
croissants were very flay and good but what i liked about the stay was the pathway that led to the pool and beach the idyllic settings the cobbler roads and the amazingly huge bathroom the fruits and the breakfast spread was also great
staff not particularly friendly food overpriced and kitchen staff dishonest about available dishes reaches not great
really comfortable beds awesome bar and pool good food cool hangout area friendly staff fun social atmosphere would stay at again
the villa with a pool was so beautiful and very close to the beach and the restaurant the food at the hotels restaurant was divine and reasonable prices i absolutely loved sea even though massage were more expensive than other places outside the resort it was definitely worth it we came home manned and relaxed we will visit spree same again

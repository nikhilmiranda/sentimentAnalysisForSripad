except st floor building is too simplest looks like a hospital but everything is very clean and it is quiet enough to be relaxed一瞬病院と思うくらい白くてびっくりする建物なのですが、とても清潔ですし、問題ありません。of、アメニティは充実していないのでご注意を。toothbrush and paste are not set
the location is a bit far away from the reaches but definitely good if you want to enjoy a quiet vacation
iron didn quite make the room cool enough made for a restless start to the night
it was in a quiet location but was good for us as we were just going to the full moon party so was ideal next to the big buddha pier the room was spacious and really comfortable great value for money
one building away from the beach central to lamp fantastic location in the center if things but still quiet with birds chirping and no traffic sounds
the location was ideal for me i wanted to stay in a quiet part of oh same away from the business of chewing etc the room was perfect for me plenty of space and very comfortable staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast and coffee were fantastic
it was very quiet  lovely little spot on the coast with some local attractions either side
quiet and nice friendly staff ready to help good transportation to downtownbreakfast was very good not so much to choose from like other big hotels but good quality and you dont miss anything
proximity to the beach was great and a quiet part of the beach too
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
firstly we received an upgrade to a beach front bungalow which was stunning and we couldn be more thankful for in sure the original room would have been great but this made our stay even more memorable we had been on the road for  months and been staying in often ultra budget accommodation so for us this was a major plunge  although actually the prices are exceptionally reasonable the bed was the comfiest we have stayed in for months the room was huge the large fridge in the living area allowed us to stock up on fruit bees the veranda provided a place to enjoy said fruit bees the pool was clean and cool the beach was small but private the water clear with a little opportunity for sparkling although most of the coral is dead kayaks available to explore further out walking distance to bars and restaurant short taxi or sooner ride into lamp if that your thing overall a superb relaxing end to this chapter of our trip breakfast was great too

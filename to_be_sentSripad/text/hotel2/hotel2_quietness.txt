great beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
i requested a room at the far end away from the beach so that i could have some quiet time when i wanted    this was granted at my request    
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
beds were uncomfortable and it’s impossible to sleep before  due to noise really not the hotel you choose if you want a quiet stay we wanted to party so we loved it was charged on departure for make and dirt on towel which hadn’t been an issue at any other hotel
room is big and very clean good location if you want to party if you want a quiet night in not a good idea to stay here loud music go on till am then the beach club finished you hear drunk people leaving staffs are friendly food is great party here great worth the money room very clean
beautiful beach and pools really nice garden with superb flowers and plants great breakfast and pool bar service close to the main street but still quiet place
we had the dulled room excellent room had everything you need looked great and the hotel was right on the beach the beach here was nice and quiet for being in middle of chewing staff went out of their way to help you at all times
very nice boutique hotel very friendly staff very good food the beach is nice but quiet
nice and quiet beach nice relaxing area at the pool restaurant with beautiful sea view free karay will fit only to old people and families with small children
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
quiet location with no hawkers bothering you you can hand feed the tropical fish in the sea nice big bungalow very clean room staff were friendly and sir management were very helpful excellent value for what we paid
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
fabulous hotel spacious rooms and bathroom large come beds good air con immaculate gardens lovely pool area beach bar happy hour  superb breakfast worth booking a deluge roomvilla as these are located away from the very busy main road great beachside location quiet a little piece of paradise would love to return
peace and quiet
the beach is quiet and beautiful and the price for the room is ok
great location  min walk on the beach to chewing city quiet and a nice beach
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
the room was great large and very cool comfortable luxurious even
great beach front rooms in a great location at the quiet end of chewing lowed the sea and the romantic feel of the that style rooms and the kiss loved the modern style room
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
for a hostel it was cool that they had a roof top bar
nice location next to the fisherman’s village but still quiet for the night good rooms and sea area
staff and the owners are very friendlyfood is very deliciousfree pool tableunbelievable sweet cats and dogsnetflix in some roomsadvice its in the middle of nowhere we just stayed one night so it was fine for us if you anna have a silent and remote accommodation that the one for you
close to the beach restaurant small shops and some landmarks quiet enough although the hotel is on the road room cleaning every day
too basic for my liking wood trotting in huts making floors uneven and overhead canopy on porch patch the wooden windows are blackened with the decay it was very quiet but can imagine when busy full of young travellers it would be a friendly community feel
wifi could have been better small but very nice and cool pool
sadly the electricity generations are very noisy during the day its not the property fault but its unfortunate location is very quiet and a bit empty in this season but good for those couples who just want to lay at the pool less suited for solo travellers
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables

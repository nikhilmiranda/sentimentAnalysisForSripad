no hot water chair was to low to sit and use computerbathroom looked great but didn function shelling or place to keep your stuff  air conditioned was right over the bed and at its lowest it was blasting freezing cold hair on the bedcould not sleep with it onto cold  each time i woke up sweating sat on the couch and let it run for ten unturned it off and went back to bed  the art of all design is functionality its one thing for stuff to look great but if it doesn serve the purpose then it fails they must think in terms of people actually using the roomsthey were large well done nice bed lots of plugs and a big balconythink about what people do in the rooms besides look at them in in worse in among at the moment and i wish i had stayed in same at the ark is in a trained interior and theatre designer retired
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
breakfast is standard nothing to shout about but this is the best place to stay if you want to move around for food and shopping  best party by the beach  awesome view and the beach is just down the corner  loved it
the staff was very helpful and friendly you can book a sooner at the hotel very easy the view from the hotel is nice the position is very good
privacy of the villa was great   wonderful view  quit place for relaxing
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
nice and quiet beach nice relaxing area at the pool restaurant with beautiful sea view free karay will fit only to old people and families with small children
excellent view and access to the beach well maintained grounds staff were helpful as well as friendly strong wifi which was very useful as i was working too  the hotel itself is a bit hidden located at the end of the road but accessible to nearby shops cases and restaurant
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
i don’t think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i’ve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
receptionists very friendly and helpful organized my travel to oh to nice view from the backside over beach and bout area and good to chill out
we upgrade to a bungalow on the beach with our own pool the room was really comfortable and the view of the beach was fabulous  the restaurant was good the staff were great and it was great value for money  i would definitely return
the rooms with the jacuzzi and pool are amazing with see view and not so expensive  the managers and the worker
the beach is clean and beautiful  the restaurant has beach view couldn ask for better breakfast spread want big but all the food was taste  swimming pool is a mid size not many people swim so was never crowded  just around the corner from fisherman village which has a big selection of restaurant and shopping stalls on friday and mondaysstaff is very tentative and kind always greet you with smiles
beyond good service and staff clean and beautiful view of sea love this hotel
atmosphere clearness overall look
we were in a family room first spacious newly remarked and on the ground floor but later on changed to  deluge rooms with  king size beds very nice view over the large pool area and into the garden
nice sea view from villafriendly staff
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
swimming pool is nice with its view
view is amazing
service and food were amazing loved the view from my room as well as from the pool
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
amazing view and really friendly people you have any questions you can just ask them and they will help youalso renting a sooner at the hotel is really easy
the room was so incredible big and the balcony too you had a view in three directions
my wifi and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
but i believe that other rooms which has a sea view are better
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
nothing  maybe another curtain in the massage room since people can and unfortunately do stand there and look would be a little more relaxing with that extra bit of privacy but the message was fantastic
variation of breakfast look the same everyday not what we expected for the price we paid
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
the entrance and reception look quite bad the first impression is really important i felt like i’m in a  stars resort until i saw the roomsome new equipment for the grm will be awesome
there were many rocks in the beach just outside the resort making swimming more difficult we upgrade from our original booking the room booked was called superior double with garden view it was very old small and disappointing as not like the photo on bookingcomor taken many years ago unfortunately  some of the staff spoke and understood only a little english making communication more difficultno hot water chair was to low to sit and use computerbathroom looked great but didn function shelling or place to keep your stuff  air conditioned was right over the bed and at its lowest it was blasting freezing cold hair on the bedcould not sleep with it onto cold  each time i woke up sweating sat on the couch and let it run for ten unturned it off and went back to bed  the art of all design is functionality its one thing for stuff to look great but if it doesn serve the purpose then it fails they must think in terms of people actually using the roomsthey were large well done nice bed lots of plugs and a big balconythink about what people do in the rooms besides look at them in in worse in among at the moment and i wish i had stayed in same at the ark is in a trained interior and theatre designer retired

the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
we had the dulled room excellent room had everything you need looked great and the hotel was right on the beach the beach here was nice and quiet for being in middle of chewing staff went out of their way to help you at all times
lots of water sports equipment available  sums and kayaks and life vests are provided you can also sail on a small catamaran the staff always help with anything related to water sports
i don’t think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i’ve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff were so friendly and happy to help a short walk from the centre of chewing  mind max it was far enough away to avoid all the noise but close enough to easily get to
everything great staff great atmosphere and fantastic facilities the staff bent over backwards to help
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
amazing view and really friendly people you have any questions you can just ask them and they will help youalso renting a sooner at the hotel is really easy
got a manure that was not great staff’s level of english was pretty poor and made it difficult to get help on some things but they were extremely polite

not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food
its a good  min walk from the centre of lamp the pool and sea are actually in another building on the opposite side of a very busy road although i hey do have a security guard there to help you cross
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help the breakfast buffets was white overpriced for what was on offer
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end

expensive food and drinks
i did find the food and drinks more expensive here than surrounding restaurant and bars
restaurant prices were a bit expensive
very expensive for the areapoor breakfastover crowded pools
expensive drinks late night noise
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
good location cheap room rate
quite expensive drinks compared to bars out off the resort
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that’s to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
restaurant very delicious food not cheap but worth it
the rooms with the jacuzzi and pool are amazing with see view and not so expensive  the managers and the worker
the pool the restaurant the friendly staff  ooh our friendly pool bar guy was so great and really good with our kiss too our friends stayed nearby at a more expensive hotel and were disappointed when they saw we got a better deal with better facilities
you get what you pay for its a cheap villa ok for what you payoutside shower was very nice
nothing really the ladies that ran it were nice but the hotel its self was very poor run down needs a big upgrade i know its cheap but  on booking no way very disappointed left after one night
huge apartment nice swimming pool almost without other visitors delicious food in a restaurant cheap and reliable looters to rent close to the centre chewing
not accessible to strolled they have many stairs for each direction you go it is hard to move with a strolled also no pool for kidsshower is very strange it has  door sharing with the toilet and it is glass so everyone  can take a peak main pool bar is expensive
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
cheap perfume
the resort is not very that  the design is very contemporary which was lovely but perhaps may not be to some’s taste on the beach the ocean stays shallow for a long time and also has some rocks so it is better for bathing than swimming also it is not super close to bars and restaurant taxes on same are expensive but the hotel restaurant is great anyway for those staying a long time transport could become a large cost
everything is expensive including transportation
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost
the hotel restaurant is expensive considering the other ones located next to it and serving same amazing that food
the room service was little expensive
no drinking water next to the pool and the beach you have to order drinks from the bar kiss are spending many hours on the beach and pool and need to drink a lot i think water cooper should be complementary buying mineral water in large bottles which isn’t expensive even can be done only outside of the resort
everything was wonderful but we had booked it as all inclusive as that is what it said but it was far from all inclusiveyou could only eat certain foods from certain venus and only soft drinks where inclusive so couldn do all we wanted as we didn budget for all we had to spend
prices in restaurant shakes etc are very expensive
dont trust the online maps telling you there is a store or an at nearby the only way to find those without walking for half a day is to rent a motorbike or pay for the taxi the taxi as always on the islands is very expensive the minimum fare is  bath for a one way trip to lips not pier be advised though that this hotel is not on the main route for hotel transfers despite being very close to the pier the van waiting may ask you more than  bath so its not a bad idea to call the hotel to plan your transfer from the pier
there ware a lot of problem with the room  toilet the window air condition the hotel is not on the main road so the only ay to get a taxi is to order from the hotel and it is always big cars and expensive

the noise from one room to another the walls are thin and even if they brush the teeth you can hear themrecommdation put to the windows mosquito net
wifi was terrible and only worked periodically room was very basic and was not like the pictures portray and not at all good value for money
the wifi
been here like  times over the years internet is now open to everyone no password internet was slow and went down often for a couple hours reception staff not friendly or helpful
excellent view and access to the beach well maintained grounds staff were helpful as well as friendly strong wifi which was very useful as i was working too  the hotel itself is a bit hidden located at the end of the road but accessible to nearby shops cases and restaurant
my wifi and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn‚Äôt be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the internet did not work
wifi connection was very bad the smell from the water in the shower was disgusting but got better after a while hot meals on the breakfast buffets was not actually hot
the room had  fan but was really hot during the day and night the rooms also smelled of damp and really in need of a make over wifi only available downstairs and want great signal
wifi could have been better small but very nice and cool pool
strange that the included breakfast menu had champagne on it but it was never available  my room had tree branches overflowing onto the balcony and when the wind blew there was an almighty scraping sound of the branches onto the woodwork fortunately it want windy at night or sleep would have been impossible  i remember the wifi as being rather weak but i experienced that elsewhere in same
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states ‚Äúairport scuttle‚Äù which is not free description states ‚Äúcanning‚Äù but that is not offered at the hotel
we paid for breakfast but at the hotel we were told that no breakfast will be served due to closing of the restaurant wifi connection was coexisting didn work anywhere on the hotel areaalso some major construction work was going on  peters from the room luckily we didn sleep long üòÄ

miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional ¬£ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don‚Äôt release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they‚Äôre all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn‚Äôt have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn‚Äôt need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn‚Äôt go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that‚Äôs all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
wifi never worked during our three night stay the villa we booked was actually one half of a villa with no noise drooping we could literally hear the conversations in the next room cleanliness was a miss the villa or the room actually didn appear very clean breakfast had very little option and most of the times were not filled when anything finished in the buffets
the rooms need an upgrade bathroom is tired wifi could be better but who spends their time at the internet that much anyway on holiday
basis of hotel are right just needs a bit of maintenance can see that not much work gets done dealing around pool some boards are loose and screws sticking up wifi is patch and on nd floor almost unable had to go to lobby
not hotels fault but the beach is not good for babies as it is not shallow and the sea was pretty wavy also even tough wifi reception was good the connection is very slow

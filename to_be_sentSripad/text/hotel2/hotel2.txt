expensive food and drinks
everything for us was fine but if you don‚Äôt like noise don‚Äôt stay here music is loud and on until late again for us this was great i did find the food and drinks more expensive here than surrounding restaurant and bars
nothing
amazing experience
i really can‚Äôt think of anything that i didn‚Äôt like  this place is just simply amazing
this place is one of the best hotels to stay at in fact you‚Äôll see people from other hotels paying and coming over for poolparty at arbat
it took a little while before the warm water came on and then it was very hot
great beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
location cleanliness pools access to the beach and parties
everything was great
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
room smelt musty uncomfortable beddoor didn‚Äôt lock properly
air hang oven bed
beach bar
the shower is too old  can adjust the height or direction it‚Äôs change to new modern shower could be much better
pool party beach  restaurant
you need to pay  bath extra for the girl but only if you stay in hotel not alone
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it‚Äôs noisy but only till  am
first of all its not really a party until pm  dont expect the pm pool party to be crazy its mostly families the staff are super strict on the rules  you only get one towel with your key cards per day which they dont tell you also the power annoying shuts off whenever you take the key out of the room which is good for the hotel to save power but really annoying when its  degrees f and your room is boiling hot because the ac shuts off every single time you leave
the location is great  your right near a ton of shopping in same and the property is right on the beach and has great poolbeach bars the  pools are pretty nice and there is a good music vice
beach right along the hotel is rocky and not suitable for swimming though about  metre towards right its excellent
party atmosphere with loud music do dancing crowd  fire show at beachfront every nightalso  swimming pools
poor of in the room
location is very goodfriendly staffcomfortable rooms
noon
the breakfast was good but you can only choose  items from the breakfast
best location on the island specially if you like an active stay  also they throw the best beach parties
nothing to dislike
ark bar was an amazing stay me and my friend stayed for  nights but wished we stayed longer the beach party was amazing with a great fire show music and atmosphere
best place you cannot dislike anything
pools party upgrade room super awesome
◊î◊õ◊ú
i generally disliked oh same which has nothing to do with this hotel
i definitely liked the location and accommodation in my opinion this hotel was a good value for the money also there were some quite nice parties at night which i really likedon the other hand i dont think this hotel is really for solo travelers  for couples friends and anyone looking for parties  sure but for solo travelers  ah
if your not into loud music then this is not a place where you would want to staymusic doesn‚Äôt stop until am on most nights
location was the best assetwhere the rooms were nice and cosy
wifi was not reliable and dropped off constantly could not stay connected for more than  seconds at a time
close to beach and downtown chewing
very well trained staff and excellent service  precise and professional
room
location
would have liked some hot water in the shower
i requested a room at the far end away from the beach so that i could have some quiet time when i wanted    this was granted at my request    as a female travelling alone  being in the business spot meant that i felt safe going out  either to the street nighttime or beach party    i did not need to catch any public transport home or be alone and vulnerable at night
restaurant prices were a bit expensive
rooms were clean and comfortable perfect vice by the pool in the day and beach at night
the staff
nothing
good location helpful staff

no hot water chair was to low to sit and use computerbathroom looked great but didn function shelling or place to keep your stuff  air conditioned was right over the bed and at its lowest it was blasting freezing cold hair on the bedcould not sleep with it onto cold  each time i woke up sweating sat on the couch and let it run for ten unturned it off and went back to bed  the art of all design is functionality its one thing for stuff to look great but if it doesn serve the purpose then it fails they must think in terms of people actually using the roomsthey were large well done nice bed lots of plugs and a big balconythink about what people do in the rooms besides look at them in in worse in among at the moment and i wish i had stayed in same at the ark is in a trained interior and theatre designer retired
breakfast was a great big breakfast dealexcellent
bit prices for meals and breakfast not included when it said it was when i selected it on bookingcom
everything is pretty good here good spot for young people nice pools and beach loud music and fire displays on the beach i wouldn stay here with young kiss as music is banging on until am i would stay here again this was my nd time at arbat

none
the hotel is lovely location beautiful facilities and nice live gathers and friendly staff
most guests staying in this hotel are rude slur and drunk all the timefull of hedonistic arrogant and empty people guests
close to main area in chewing staff is polite
nothing üòÅ
great value for money we had a room that wasn‚Äôt too loud from the pool party when we had finished for the night the property has everything on site such as sundry services massage taxi  sooner higher pool party was the best definitely coming back
i was kept up until am due to the neighbor having a house party and the constant slamming of doors i was also charged money for a missing cup that was actually just in another room and it was removed by the cleaner before i could take it to my room the next day
the breakfast was amazing it‚Äôd a lot better than having the breakfast buffets
it has everything you need you don‚Äôt need to move at all
no hot water in the shower the staff wasn‚Äôt nice and attentive they didn‚Äôt listen to the problem and didn‚Äôt fix it we showered in cold water throughout the stay
the owner was soooooo iceland helpful
wifi
restaurant atmosphere music meet people from different places
hard to charge my phone electricity not that good our room was located in good spot as we‚Äôd asked for
location was good  pool beach close so much good ac bar and environment
definitely over prices for what you get operated on most webster lots of parting loud planes breakfast very average
the location
sun beds were open to anyone so if you we‚Äôre up late they would be gone to other people from different hotels at no cost
very clean
breakfast is the same every day
party and pool
water in shower are cold mostly have big party at the beach every night until am so it very loud and annoying if you try to sleep before that
breakfast is nice they have great beach parties every day and night
nothing
the position of the hotel and it offers a great night out with fantastic staff
after housekeeping the floor is still very sandy
walking distance to a lot of shops
amazing location beach is unreal

ideal location excellent staff and very clean
everything was perfect
its so close to the beach yet the place was kept clean n tidy from beach sands
it‚Äôs hard to accept so much noise which lasts every night until gone  am perhaps rooms further back from the front are less noisy a pump made loud noise every  seconds behind our room
very well managed polite helpful staff the bed was comfortable the room was well designed and the bathroom was great tree bar pool was excellent and just steps to the beach the breakfast included was good quality and ample choice food in the restaurant was good
high voices difficulty to sleep its place for people who likes to party but not for me
to food is the best in this hotel
overpriced no value for money the pool party is highly operated
location
the noise from one room to another the walls are thin and even if they brush the teeth you can hear themrecommdation put to the windows mosquito net
the team from the location
does what it says on the canthought it was going to be too heavy was great
great location directly on the beach poolparties
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
no personal suffer
minimal
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn‚Äôt an issue you should know you‚Äôre getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
these guns have it down to a science since they move so many people in and out very efficient extremely clean pool was fantastic and beach access was steps away highlight of our trip was lounging poolside and the fire shows great place to visit and explore the rest of the island too
temperature of water in shower kept going from hot to cold also there no shower door so the bathroom floor tends to get wet while showering
everything else
expensive drinks late night noise
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
there is nothing not to love about this place
breakfast is standard nothing to shout about but this is the best place to stay if you want to move around for food and shopping  best party by the beach  awesome view and the beach is just down the corner  loved it
nothing
i always stay in this hotel and it is awesome especially its beach every day there is a party and swimming pool too i have stayed there  times i love it
full of prostitutes who walks around the hotel as in the street
beach is very close
charged us for complimentary water
location was far beach parties were good great hotel and a fair price would definitely stay again
wifi was terrible and only worked periodically room was very basic and was not like the pictures portray and not at all good value for money
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
h which counted is close to everywhere restaurant markets and places of stay which counted beautiful place it will be in the next womanüíôüíô
nothing i could describe we didn like about the property
the hotel is really nice location and also very friendly staff with all the facilities under one roof also the hotel allowed us an early check in co of availability and the request for late check out was offered with a normal fee till  in evening as we had a late flightoverall buds to the ark bar beach resort
great resort for people who want to party by the pool beach or just want to relax
location is good and the pool area is nice
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don‚Äôt like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
i liked the position and the pools the party was good
got a bit loud at night  was hard to sleep if you weren‚Äôt drunk this was expected though due to type of hotel it is
good location right on beach front close to most stuff  airport  piers for if you‚Äôre moving to other oh islands rooms were spacious also staff were good lively at night with a lot going on fire shows dancers etc
the beds are extremely uncomfortable and the sheets are like sandpaper
good location cheap room rate
not much to dislike  except for the weather which was terrible for  days due to the massive cycling which hit oh same on fro and sat
harry and his team at reception did a fantastic job super friendly and will to assist wherever possible the hotel is rewarded with great staff housekeeping did a great job along with the bar and restaurant staff great place for the young at heart party all day from  am
i would like to stay again
very nice hotel i would love to come again really  nice hotel
behaviour of the reception staff
reception staff  not so helpful and courteous
considering we were wrapped indoors we watched a lot of to the to was a little old and didn‚Äôt work very well but if the sun is shining you would never even put the to on so this is not anything to put anyone of would stay again
hotel was great and lively to no fault of their own we were unable to experience the whole reason we booked with storm pack hitting the island we were wrapped indoors shame but staff and everything to do with room were great
you can‚Äôt get much sleep because people are up right through the night drinking it‚Äôs a great hotel if you want to party if you ant to chill i definitely would stay somewhere else
location and atmosphere was great if you like to party
always noisy in the rooms hard to sleep
party all the time
staff is robotic not very friendly or helpful made le feel like a room number rowdy clients
good location for chewing attractions
the whole decorations of the hotel the rooms receptions where not too nice i really was expecting a fancier place they put more effort in the party and bars rather than the hotel and roomsthe staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
it has the best environment you must probably need around all the islandit‚Äôs location was amazing shops bars restaurant etc were only walking distance from the place they offer the best parties and have great pools and lovely beach
the wifi
the location and the staff especially to said he made are stay amazing because of him i‚Äôll be coming back next year  thank you
only thing is the bed wasn‚Äôt very come and we had a mosquito problem  had to have it sprayed
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
i booked from booking and i paid with my credit card and when i went for choking in the woman in the reception said ok sir you confirmed your booking and you already paid but we need you credit card to take photo i show her my credit card with my name and my passport and i tell her for what you need a copy of my card she said dont worry sir it will be secret nobody will use it but i said no its my card and in already paid from booking and i will not give you a photo of my card with my account numbersfor the first time in my life a hotel ask about this
good location and good food have fun in swimming pool with do all the day
restaurant food is of poor quality lacking that flavor the room is very small and lacks door the price for food and drinks are higher than surrounding areas like next door but guess that is what happens on a resort
the amenities such as the three pools pool tables and parties
there is  no smoking  room
was good party hotel if you not into party then choose other hotel
the beer and food was about double the price of the restaurant and bars across the road the music was mostly hip hop cap and constant boomboom of speakers everywhere took away from the beautiful beach setting it was a challenge to eat or drink or sit anywhere where there was no smoke my room was non smoking but all the rooms around were not two rooms across from mine had four chain smokers and they sat in front and smoked day and night at night i was approached by a criminal selling bad stuff next to the hotel the beach is not safe at night so dont wander alone on the beach at night
the service was good the area was well managed and parking for guests was free on the beach each night there was a fire show no mosquito bites unless you sit next to some plants where they seem to stay
hawkers are in force
awesome party vice most lively place in chawengpool parties wed  fro  music and entertainment kicks starts at pm and powers through to close to everything and is by the beachalcohol was reasonably prices for the locationfood was tastyfor the party animals a must
no complaints here
i liked the vagrant atmosphere food good but also surrounded by some amazing restaurant of all cuisines free breakfast is cooked to order on the beach front ark bar is for the young or the old who want to feel young again
everything had cockroaches in our room and the guy from the front desk told us there is nothing he can do they have cockroaches in all rooms
nothing
quite expensive drinks compared to bars out off the resort
beach is nice quite clot off things to do in the area
the hotel is very loud at night when the pool parties are on so just to be aware of that otherwise a great location and brilliant if you want to party
staff are everywhere and very attentive this place is a party of you don‚Äôt like to party book somewhere else
none
it was clean and in the center of all the action the staff were very nice and helpful
too noisy at evening time stayed  days nobody clean my room even after asking do so in morning time
nothing much but i wish it was pet friendly
everything love this placearkbar resort is my favourite visit this place second timeswill be come again husband just loved the was literally thanking me for booking this place  üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüíêüíêüíêüéâüéäü•Ç

location  music  staff
excellent location if you‚Äôre planning to party it‚Äôs a bit loud and we did have a lady screaming all night but i was able to get a good night‚Äôs rest ark is a few steps away and the location couldn‚Äôt have been better close to many restaurant massage places and clubs
great for parting have pool parties every day and beach parties twice a week perfect location on chewing beach
best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that‚Äôs to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
the food could have been better
perfect for parting
rumors and loud music until late night
location and facilities
the food is not that great
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
beds were uncomfortable and it‚Äôs impossible to sleep before  due to noise really not the hotel you choose if you want a quiet stay we wanted to party so we loved it was charged on departure for make and dirt on towel which hadn‚Äôt been an issue at any other hotel
best place to stay if you want to party always busy and fun great location would still stay again  great place to mingle
facilities
location
this is best for beach party food and location

location and price
overall is very good swimming pool is amazing walking distance to shops and the beach staff were really nice
we loved everything about the hotel the rooms the food the pool and the beach are all excellent if you want somewhere that‚Äôs out of the much more commercial centre of lamp this is an ideal choice you can still get into lamp in under  mind by taxi or rent a sooner
the pool area is a great spot to relax and have cocktail
the staff was very helpful and friendly you can book a sooner at the hotel very easy the view from the hotel is nice the position is very good
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave

we upgrade to a bungalow on the beach with our own pool the room was really comfortable and the view of the beach was fabulous  the restaurant was good the staff were great and it was great value for money  i would definitely return
spacious room
the rooms with the jacuzzi and pool are amazing with see view and not so expensive  the managers and the worker
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don‚Äôt want to travel as backpackers but don‚Äôt want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the place is close to beach and other happening places around good variety of the food nearby and some great bars to have some chill moment the room was not spacious but not too small as well so its an obey
beautiful place big swimming pool quite place just a few minutes from fisherman village we also rent a motor bike for a good price big bedroom
the location is really convenient as it was very close to the airport main pier and some of the more tourist areas in same like he fisherman village and the big buddha
good location
the pool the restaurant the friendly staff  ooh our friendly pool bar guy was so great and really good with our kiss too our friends stayed nearby at a more expensive hotel and were disappointed when they saw we got a better deal with better facilities
so close to the beach and room was lovely and clean
in the heart oft tourist district but not noisyroom was but stains on the ceiling pool is ok
lovely owners made us feel very welcome very relaxed feel we came and went as we pleased
the dermoid resort is so beautiful it is perfect place to enjoy your holidays it has two wonderful swinmingpools and the beach is also where the resort is you have just to down one step the rooms are very comfortable too
really good position close to the beach and restaurant shops daily cleaning and fresh water room was clean and come staff was kind luggage deposit available
amazing stay at this resort would definitely recommend to my friends and family
great beach and very nice contest taxi and filipino staff is amazing very taking care of us and well supporting every request the rooms are very nice and clean
the beach is clean and beautiful  the restaurant has beach view couldn ask for better breakfast spread want big but all the food was taste  swimming pool is a mid size not many people swim so was never crowded  just around the corner from fisherman village which has a big selection of restaurant and shopping stalls on friday and mondaysstaff is very tentative and kind always greet you with smiles
i spent four nights at relate as a solo traveler and it was absolutely fantastic the standout for me was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff the room pool and resort were absolutely immaculate the breakfast was delicious and gave plenty of energy for a wide range of activities that the resort can organise for you there are three shutters a day to chewing which makes this resort really easy to access the busier side of the island but is remote enough for you to really relax and get away from it all
it is well located
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
excellent beautiful resort will definitely return breakfast and international restaurant on the beach were magnificent staff were friendly and very helpful rooms comfortable and clean also had a great sea experience

me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one

my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
i don‚Äôt understand all the negative reviews at all we stayed for  nights and enjoyed every second of it the place is right onto may am beach with a bar lounge chairs hanging chair a shower and a pool in the morning a good breakfast is served with amazing beachsea views the room itself is small but copy and we had enough space for our luggage they provided shower towels and beach towels which are changed every day we also rented a motorbike as this is the best way to explore the islandlastly the hotel is located in chinatown so there are many shops and restaurant located only  min away on thursday the nearby shopping street turns into a lively nightmare a must go
very friendly staff amazing hotel inch pool  panoramaview
perfect to relax and escape from a busy places
very clean rooms would definitely come back
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch

nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the bed was very come the sea was excellent the pools were excellent the size of the room was also excellent
the location is amazing the stuff is extremely friendly the hotel is exactly on the beach with beds
it‚Äôs the cleanest hotel i have seen and they wrote us a personal message to welcome us with a cake but the cake wasn‚Äôt in the fridgelollucky i don‚Äôt have a sweet toothnot big issuewonderful set pool and amazing breakfast
the hotel is just amazing we had a room with a private pool and it was like heaven the staff is amazing the cocktail are good and the restaurant are fantastic shame its so far from home as i could see myself going back every year
the deluge villa with plunge pool was fantastic restaurant nice location with overpriced nice food
staff were very nice and accommodation
big and secure
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
generally a very nice resort good value really nice and helpful staff
pool breakfast sea
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
great facilities on the door step to the beach  having a private pool was great  easy to get the team to set us up at the beach  which was a very short walk  good air conditioning and friendly team  short walk to  up the street  nice stroll down the beach to some great restraints and the night market on thursdays  personal mobile to call reception
the location close to chewing walking street
free update to villa  ll
bedroom is spacious and clean

everything was perfect lovely stuff beautiful rooms nice breakfast and very close to beach i would recommend
the location of the hotel is great as it is directly on the beach the breakfast was nice and the rooms and grounds were always clean however if you want a quieter stay i suggest staying away from chewing and staying in bout
very well maintained helpful staff and a relaxing pool
staff were absolutely fantastic particularly restaurant polar staff  gorgeous room and bed so come  great resort
great little studio room opposite the pool great pool lovely staff on site bike hire close enough to walk to the main chewing street mind which also makes it very peaceful in the resort they gave us a pleasant upgrade so we extended our stay highly recommend
rooms staff locations  access to main road and beach
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
view is amazing
pool breakfast and rooms are great really enjoined my stay here
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
great beach front rooms in a great location at the quiet end of chewing lowed the sea and the romantic feel of the that style rooms and the kiss loved the modern style room
was great
very happy and polite staff no problems during our stay
green hilly territory not typical for same hotels nice sandy beach but was windy during our stay in early february excellent restaurant canal large nice rooms great grm helpful and friendly staff
location just far enough to enjoy the busy beach but also enjoy the peaceful beach different evenings the hotel put on
the villas
i would recommend this property to all who are thinking about theirs holiday with childrenlovely pools big pool access into the sea beach  simply including breakfast  very  good  lovelythank you for the provided hospitality  parcel bartonickova am travel prague
service and food were amazing loved the view from my room as well as from the pool
the property was in a perfect location such good value for money and amazing views
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
very  nice resort
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
we were travelling with a family of  people the kiss being  years of age we all pretty much liked everything thus we can absolutely recommend the hotel the personnel was outstanding very friendly and kind in any regards it would be too time consuming to mention all positive aspects
if you want to stay only in the property it could be the best choice
place amazing sex go back longer than  month
staff all friendly just loved it
very good massaged i think one of the best ever
great views across the beach from dining areas eating and drinking with sand between your toes the swimming pool and dining areas were great this place is an oasis to the rustle and bustle some of the best that food you will ever taste great live music on sundays very comfortable massive beds
resort was beautiful and buffets breakfast had quite a good selection to choose from rooms were very spacious and staff made you feel like you were a valued guest the hotel offered a complementary scuttle service into chewing and the fisherman village at certain times which was a big plus we also hired a sooner through the hotel which was done at a fairly reasonable rate of  bath per day
the beach is very nice and secluded but sea was very rough in december so not much swimming possible most of the female staff are very polite and friendly and obliging sea is great  dont pick the fancy packages they are not value for money the room is very comfortable and large but again you need to get used to up and down within the room as well
we really liked the swimming pool and the location the resort has an overall luxury feeling and is well maintained
great location and value for money the kiss loved the pool
spacious clean room comfortable bed good breakfast
staff was very nice and the beach was amazing looked like paradise breakfast was excellent
extra living space is fabulous plenty of room to relax other than standard bedroom hotel should really stress advertise this as being key up in comparison with other hotels
amazing view and really friendly people you have any questions you can just ask them and they will help youalso renting a sooner at the hotel is really easy
the food  staff facility was the best we stayed in the pool villa and we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
for a hostel it was cool that they had a roof top bar
the stuff is amazing very warming and very helpful
worst bed in the world rooms were not cleaned till  pm hotel was not expecting us on our arrival shocking most guests around pool area was from a sister hotel
a nice familyrun resort with beach and swimming pool offering very reasonable prices for same everything gives excellent value for money including the restaurant
i like the long low no noise peaceful
the staff were so helpful as i got there a day earlier than i should do they booked me straight into the room  and after a rain storm  can thank the staff enough excellent well done
nice location next to the fisherman‚Äôs village but still quiet for the night good rooms and sea area
staff and the owners are very friendlyfood is very deliciousfree pool tableunbelievable sweet cats and dogsnetflix in some roomsadvice its in the middle of nowhere we just stayed one night so it was fine for us if you anna have a silent and remote accommodation that the one for you
beach the staff big room
rooms are spacious nice pool area and situated quieter end of chewing
location very good  lovely pool area
room excellent and location close to beach and shopping area
the room was so incredible big and the balcony too you had a view in three directions
the staff is very kind  one of them is perry that was just wonderful
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
close to the beach restaurant small shops and some landmarks quiet enough although the hotel is on the road room cleaning every day
the property is in a great position nice pools  friendly staff

staff are lovely friendly and helpful  service was great
very polite staff
the pool access villa was nice room  very clean the lap pool was lovely to swim staff in restaurant were very  friendly it was always nice to see noun  rook from the restaurant as they were always happy  welcoming
nothing to be honest maybe bed n pillows were ok
friendly staff
stunning views
excellent food
restaurant for a romantic meal was lovely location great to get around and next to ark bar which was great for a party and flame throws
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i‚Äôd had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
bed air con to had english stations
comfortable location
good value for the money
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
my wifi and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
if you are near the road end of the property the traffic noise can be a little intrusion

the hotel had an idyllic setting on the beach with a good infinity pool the italian livid restaurant was on the waters edge and excellent food happy hour was from   pm handy outside but outside hotel very disappointing
nothing i can think of i just wish id taken more photo to show you how awesome the passage was
odor di uffa in reception
equipment in the grm was dated
cleanliness of the room could be improved
i didn like our room it was a bit dusty and dark
but i believe that other rooms which has a sea view are better
beds are a bit uncomfortable
shampoo shower get
not accessible to strolled they have many stairs for each direction you go it is hard to move with a strolled also no pool for kidsshower is very strange it has  door sharing with the toilet and it is glass so everyone  can take a peak main pool bar is expensive
nothing i can think of i just wish id taken more photo to show you how awesome the passage was
big rooms friendly staff
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn‚Äôt be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
beach not good for swimming
three things could have been improved the air condition was just a bit loud the water pressure in the bathtubs was way too low despite the fact that the sink and shower had a fine water flow i prefer softer pillows on the bed
that we had to leave
you owe me  neuro please return it immediately on my bank accountthank you
too basic for my liking wood trotting in huts making floors uneven and overhead canopy on porch patch the wooden windows are blackened with the decay it was very quiet but can imagine when busy full of young travellers it would be a friendly community feel
the internet did not work
was about a ten minute walk away from the main strip
this isn really the hotels fault but the clientele was a little trash somehow it attracted lots of chalky peopleovercrowded pool areaoverpriced taxes everywhere on the island
the resort is in a jungle style location therefore there are a lot of mosquitoes and it is not good that the windows in the rooms are not closing perfectly
my room far from the beach
only one socket in bungalow its uncomfortable especially when you travel not alone
the staff on receptionrestaurant hardly speaks english and its a shame they dont understand simple questions like can you give me a weapon please or may i choose among bungalows or mine is the only one
the air in the garden sometimes stink beverage
the mattress on a bed was of spring that caused pain in back
the mattress were not comftroble the bath without window a smell of mold in sleep soothe breakfast was poor and the amount was insufficient for all the guests
attentiveness of the staffpool m cm deepfood breakfast
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
nothing not to dislike
artificial smell of the room
cheap perfume
the ac is rather loud for sleep time even when its power is turned to minimum
we stayed there on two separate occasions the second time was for just a single night in order to catch an early flight the maintenance for that room was not great small stuff which adds up
wifi connection was very bad the smell from the water in the shower was disgusting but got better after a while hot meals on the breakfast buffets was not actually hot
a bit more secluded than i would have liked but nonetheless a lovely resort
they do not provide beach towels
the resort is not very that  the design is very contemporary which was lovely but perhaps may not be to some‚Äôs taste on the beach the ocean stays shallow for a long time and also has some rocks so it is better for bathing than swimming also it is not super close to bars and restaurant taxes on same are expensive but the hotel restaurant is great anyway for those staying a long time transport could become a large cost
the room had  fan but was really hot during the day and night the rooms also smelled of damp and really in need of a make over wifi only available downstairs and want great signal
wifi could have been better small but very nice and cool pool
it is a  min walk from town but there are bushes and the owners gave us lifts
sadly the electricity generations are very noisy during the day its not the property fault but its unfortunate location is very quiet and a bit empty in this season but good for those couples who just want to lay at the pool less suited for solo travellers
the reception and restaurant staff were almost completely opposite
restaurant staff would stand there and stare at you while you topped up your plates during breakfast or while you were eating it
ask them for a towel while your in the pool and your told to get it from your room
drunk strand
location slight walk into town but worth it for the place you get construction going on down by the pool at the moment but no big deal
strange that the included breakfast menu had champagne on it but it was never available  my room had tree branches overflowing onto the balcony and when the wind blew there was an almighty scraping sound of the branches onto the woodwork fortunately it want windy at night or sleep would have been impossible  i remember the wifi as being rather weak but i experienced that elsewhere in same
there was bags ants and wall wizards
every thing
the location is far from town center
beach is away from the hotel and require a walking distance of  to  mind
surrounding areas  no restaurant or any nearby convenient shops
scuttle bus from airport to hotel or viceversa is charitable at a very high rate
i honestly can say i didn like anything
everything is expensive including transportation
no free scuttle service to airport or main shopping walls
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
because we forgot the credit card we booked and paid with back in april there was an issue at check in they refused the original card and charged us on one of the cards we had with us so we lost out on the exchange rate and bank charges
got a manure that was not great staff‚Äôs level of english was pretty poor and made it difficult to get help on some things but they were extremely polite
slightly noisy at night even in the building rooms
oh same governing body has not improved or corrected senate issues they reportedly have raw waste that run directly into our already stressed ocean do not recommend the island as a tourist destination until this issue is rectified
a lot of mosquitoes
i did not like having to pass next door suite every time we went to our room small problem but i felt we were invading their space
most everything
bad smell from the shower water
the property was little away from the main market
it was a rainy weather most of the days
the bed want comfortable the smell in the bathroom the rooms appear a bit old and require renovation
plunge pool didn work breakfast poor lacking variety  looking and structural work being done all around so no privacy even in or own pool
dirty towels and dirty sheets stains in it all other very good
food breakfast was cold at times variety was lacking
the pillows were terribly uncomfortable and hard there were tiny ants all over the room especially in the bathroom there was no iron available to use
the reception on check in had an pleasant attitude
the hotel was opened in  and so the wear and tear is visible  walls might be a little dirty tiny cracks and scratches in the furniture etc this is to be expected after operating for  years but perhaps they could ‚Äòrefresh‚Äô the rooms a little it really isn‚Äôt bad the
the whole property was very untidy  rubbish in the gardens dead plants random pillows dirty swept balcony
the smell of the bathroom was bad they were trying to cover it with air freshened
it is little difficult to find taxi beside the road not always they are going the way you anna go almost all the famous reaches and sights are a bit far from this place that the only thing we dint like about this place
the breakfast was awful cold fried eggs cold baconnot very clean we paid over ¬£ per night to stay hear and it was very  disappointing
hard bed and weak shower
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
breakfast was not great no buffets not much variety would have liked some that option
nothing  maybe another curtain in the massage room since people can and unfortunately do stand there and look would be a little more relaxing with that extra bit of privacy but the message was fantastic
non availability of the type of room i  had booked
unfortunately the hotel is not on the beach
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost
not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food
rooms were a little noisy and music was played until late which could be a problem for families with small children
a little bit noisy for couples as a lot of families and kiss were visiting there is only  treadmill at the grm sometimes kiss would come and play with grm facilities and i wish there was hotel staff supervising
the kiss swimming pool is very nice but dangerous for little kiss
the hotel restaurant is expensive considering the other ones located next to it and serving same amazing that food
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
room was small
shower very bad hardly any water came put of the tap
breakfast more asia foods and cook bacon fresh
beachfront hotel was closed for renovation however chi beach club next to it was very good
there was no cleanliness during breakfast i saw flies on the food
room was so small no facilities
no cleaning up room service
it was all good
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states ‚Äúairport scuttle‚Äù which is not free description states ‚Äúcanning‚Äù but that is not offered at the hotel
doesn have a  star hotel feel breakfast limited more of a boutique hotel bit overpriced rooms
everything was great except for the noise from the cars at night as our room was right in front of the main road
the hotel needs more mind car because  you have to wait  to  minutes before moving
the extra charge for the breakfast in the room it should be free because its far and you have to wait for the car
no hot water at early morning
beach  dirty rubbish strewn not far from port busy road outside the resort much traffic noise
a bit far out of town not really in walking distance in the heat
we paid for breakfast but at the hotel we were told that no breakfast will be served due to closing of the restaurant wifi connection was coexisting didn work anywhere on the hotel areaalso some major construction work was going on  peters from the room luckily we didn sleep long üòÄ
the room service was little expensive
when we arrived we were very disappointed at the state of the room it was very old and bathroom were gross beds were so hard and the place just looked run down we couldn‚Äôt stay there so we booked another hotel down the road
attitude of some employees
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden
nothing to do with the hotel but bout beach water is not great quality water is very cloudy
too many mosquitoes
not a negative but the bathroom could use some renovation in time the toilet was really low not the most comfortable
the iron leaned and the wifi didn work but who cares we weren there to use social media so didn bother us
insects in the villa walk under the doors in to millpool is old and all the furniture is on it last legs breakfast very limited
very bad location no delivered we tried at
beds where hard and not clot of storage for clothes
very much secluded you are pretty much forced to use their restaurant etc unless you hire a carmotor bike
the wifi was a joke not to that the password changed every two days
wish the lady cook at the egg station knew how to smile
hire a motorbike to get to chewing beach within  minutes
rooms old and need refurbishment
no safe in the room as indicated in the room descriptionpillows of the bed were too bigsome lights in the room didn work
rooms could use a small table and chairs in them balconies somehow with a bigger ratio out the front on the bottom level
no drinking water next to the pool and the beach you have to order drinks from the bar kiss are spending many hours on the beach and pool and need to drink a lot i think water cooper should be complementary buying mineral water in large bottles which isn‚Äôt expensive even can be done only outside of the resort
mosquitoes  especially next to the villa
pool in the vilna clearness
they didn meet us at the airport  as they said they would additional  bart taxi ride
we loved everything
everything was wonderful but we had booked it as all inclusive as that is what it said but it was far from all inclusiveyou could only eat certain foods from certain venus and only soft drinks where inclusive so couldn do all we wanted as we didn budget for all we had to spend
occasional sound disturbance at night from the elephant and ark beach bars
absolutely nothing the hotel was a delight
low water pressure in the shower and toilets  no beach towels
they were building the beach side of the property so there was no direct access to the beach
we were really disappointed with the lack of loungers on the level near the pool this needs to be improved to avoid confrontation
depending on where your room is located you will either have a generous sized ratio area or a smaller one
this is something to consider as if its raining its still hot and its nice to get out of your room
it was a bit grim the cleaner didn‚Äôt clean the rooms very well
minor things to improve
the room smelled like cleaner or detergent
the bed was not really comfortable
we had a twin room as we did not see that we had to mark that we want a double room during reservation
the decoration os very old fashioned and there were cockroaches in the room
bathroom had a glass wall so not private
the whole decorations of the hotel the rooms receptions where not too nice i really was expecting a fancier place they put more effort in the party and bars rather than the hotel and rooms
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
food is overpriced very noisy with planes flying over so dont stay here if you want to relax
outdoor lights are not enough at all and its scar to move around after sunsethard water supply in the rooms
on a couple of occasions the water cut out  and i would recommend the apartment have brush for sweeping and something to clean with so we can keep tidy
bed sheets could be fresh
nothing it is great
the pool generally beautiful however chemically needs better control very irritating on the eyes
needs a kiss menu as in all other things it‚Äôs a great place for children
bathroom not clean hair around the apartment floor had not been swept
not enough beach chairs
very small room and the doors wont lock staff only available until pm
house keeping just pay more attention to the fumigation of the rooms as we experienced on few occasions spiders ants bags even saw a rat but nothing to ruin our trip as it was taken care of i just wish they would make that a priority as cleanliness is extremely important to me
the bathroom they need a serious uplifts
restaurant and bar are good but really overpriced what is annoying  the prices are shown without tax and service so you have to pay  vat plus   service extra and the service is charged even if you take eg one beer from the beach bar yourself happily there is good beach bar close to the beach with very good food and reasonable prices
wifi was very bad
was informed that the use of the karay was at a cost  before booking this accommodation we were under the impression that to use the kayaks it was free
its a good  min walk from the centre of lamp the pool and sea are actually in another building on the opposite side of a very busy road although i hey do have a security guard there to help you cross
was slightly noisy due to its location but only a minor issue
the beach is not the best but ok
bungalow was at the back of the resort long and confusing route to and from reception and restaurant
the staff was sometimes not friendly almost rude
the air condition broke and the water start leaking trough the light so we must packed and changed the room in the middle of the night no apology was given from the staff
even i hardly watch to but i think they need to change to new to type
old not a problem
the water temperature for swimming pool to much cold need theater in jan
need more privacy for muslin couples on the sides of the pool
rooms are not like photo shown
not value for money
internet was not good
the private pool is bit smaller not like what it was shown in the picture the loud music from the near local bars at night
iron unit was noisy
the beach was rocky and did not allow for walking along as it didn connect to the rest of the beach as it was blocked by big rocks the food in the restaurant was very average and prices
it could not be better
avoid this property at all costs
it looks nothing like the pictures and water running from the tap is yellow the management specially a guy called fabrizio very patronizing and arrogant person who will laugh at your face when you talk said to me the water was safe to use not to drink
it might have been safe but yellow water is not a great sign
after i complained and we were checking out there were adding or replacing active carbon the their water maybe didn have any in the first place you can see in the pictures
i had more pictures but not on my phone to highlight the lack of maintenance in this place
you can get better hotels for the same money
choose wisely before committing
minor maintenance painting required looked a little tired
one downside was the beach it was frankly dirty the other was the location  it was not close to anything
the resort looked a little old breakfast was very limited and ordinary
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help the breakfast buffets was white overpriced for what was on offer
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional ¬£ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don‚Äôt release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they‚Äôre all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn‚Äôt have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn‚Äôt need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn‚Äôt go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that‚Äôs all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
breakfast option were rather limited but there are many local restaurant nearby
what food we tried in our short stay was great i would like to see more that food on menu at least a daily chess special
was surprised that there were so many families with children when we were there  years ago it was not so the beach beds were in poor condition and too few
far from town quite dark at the mirror
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
bedroom  bathroom was not very clean and dated   bedding was very dated  definitely needs an upgrade hotel has  upper floors with no lift  only stairs quite a mission to drag up a heavy suitcase  although the belly brought up our cases  it was a mission going down on check out
the facilities need some improvement the main pool was missing most of its times and to have some privacy inside the villa you need to close the blackouts even during the day the food is not that great the such was very disappointing felt foggy and not fresh at all and the breakfast option were very limited as well as a wiki beach brand was expecting better
wifi never worked during our three night stay the villa we booked was actually one half of a villa with no noise drooping we could literally hear the conversations in the next room cleanliness was a miss the villa or the room actually didn appear very clean breakfast had very little option and most of the times were not filled when anything finished in the buffets
we loved everything
prices in restaurant shakes etc are very expensive
a small shop would have been nice to buy some snacks or drinks the first shop is a  minutes walk
bathroom and fitting not to the standard
a hotel scuttle to the nearby may am beach would be desirable there is only a scuttle to the chewing beach sister resort
in not sure whether this is normal in same or not but the pipe water in jacuzzi was not that clear color was a bit yellow
variation of breakfast look the same everyday not what we expected for the price we paid
facilities are a bit old and the whole building looks like it needs a little bit of touch up renovation swimming pool is extremely small and is literally in the middle of the restaurant not comfortable
the surrounding  is not enough developed and make this part of same quite sad for low season
to reach the restaurant and than to come back you have to climb so many steps to go to the room or the reception
rooms not amazing quality but nice enough pool lounge area quite small
can‚Äôt walk anywhere from the hotel
nothing üòÑ
smell and unclean running water
pool closes pm and is missing times room smelled of like urine air conditioned smelled too and if you use it while on balcony the box will blow hot air on you lots of white man staying here with local that woman and chat on a balcony all night
the resort has grown some of the bungalows are a little tired
breakfast can be improved a bit
bed was very uncomfortable
the toilet door would not close
bathroom full of flies even when bought fly spray to kill them full again the next day not sound roofed rooms got a free upgrade to a pool room but women up by kiss at the pool early am all rooms cramped in close together
staff helpful
chairs on the cottage veranda were very uncomfortable
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date
honestly everything was great
very hard bed
had to ask for tea bags milk and sugar
it was too far out
beach not up to expectations
no beach towel provided
it was noisy at night
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
everything else
pressure of shower was very bad it was challenging to wash long hair hotel staff seemed to be tired and bored almost no smiles seemed they didn want to do their job night shift didn speak english no option even get morning coffee before am even if  breakfast was paid we went to boattrip at  and they only said that well have breakfast included there slice of cook banana and coffee is not breakfast disappointing  we had paid for breakfast no refund
the smaller beds of the kiss could be softer
rooms were very cold could not work out air con but was not a big issue
to far from everywhere and you had to be a mountain goat if you walked
noise from the street vehicles no real nature in the proximity the beach also very busy
the pool was in a bad state not maintained and they promised airport scuttle and later refused
the rooms need an upgrade bathroom is tired wifi could be better but who spends their time at the internet that much anyway on holiday
breakfast is great but main menu could be better beef with my carry was too chew i understand we are on a tropical island
fantastic place so quiet and pictures
still a little hot in the room even through i had a bed that was closer to the ac this time then before
absolutely nothing
it was so noisy all night people coming and going i was awakened every hour this really let the experience down
the room was so small i could hardly fit my luggage
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
food is not so that construction noise above woke us up as early as am
dont trust the online maps telling you there is a store or an at nearby the only way to find those without walking for half a day is to rent a motorbike or pay for the taxi the taxi as always on the islands is very expensive the minimum fare is  bath for a one way trip to lips not pier be advised though that this hotel is not on the main route for hotel transfers despite being very close to the pier the van waiting may ask you more than  bath so its not a bad idea to call the hotel to plan your transfer from the pier
lack of service in the restaurant‚Äîthe staff stayed in a corner to themselves chatting and ignored the customers
next time we would not get the dulled as walking up and down the stairs to the bathroom was a little inconvenient
things you will hatemosquitoes are everywhere you will start to stay at room to escape from crazy mosquitoes or you will scratch yourself by bleeding if you are brave enough to stay outsidehumidity level is crazy you will see  at nights and will sweat as hellsea temperature is higher than weather so taking shower is fresh way than swimmingany price you will see is not vat included they do not add in total taxes to price lists on venus or their offer
ac too loud
air con and fridge not working properly small blood stains on bed sheets
basis of hotel are right just needs a bit of maintenance can see that not much work gets done dealing around pool some boards are loose and screws sticking up wifi is patch and on nd floor almost unable had to go to lobby
not hotels fault but the beach is not good for babies as it is not shallow and the sea was pretty wavy also even tough wifi reception was good the connection is very slow
great hotel for  stars categorymaybe some beddingsrestaurant  napkins and towels could be renewed or refreshed and housekeeping management can pay a bit of attention to quality
pas de wifi
every thing was good didn have any complaints will book here again next time in in same
actually anything
this was marked as a water park but it had closed and our  year old daughter was very upset the maid was very rude and told us our feet sunk i would like my money back
the whole villa smelt extremely dusty upon arrival and although it looked completely clean it smelt unclean it was also extremely dated and is desperate for a return wouldn‚Äôt personally stay here again but was okay for what we needed it for
frequency of scuttle bus is not enough in peak season and time should be adjusted according to the request of guests swimming pool is too salt for swim
we stayed in  rooms   and   in rooms  and  there was a distinct drainage smell  which was very unpleasant for our entire stay  we also had numerous mosquitoes in our room  other than that it was a beautiful place and we enjoyed our stay
location is a bit isolated but it was very relaxed and had a good vice if someone is looking to stay out of main crowded areas its perfect
struggled with english with some members of staff but when more client people was around had no issues
the staff is sometimes not very responsive to phone calls from the room or they may forget to do something such as bringing additional bottles of water
our air conditioned  thermostat seemed to have broke in the middle of the first night resulting it to constantly turn on and off which disrupted our sleep the bathroom was not completely cleaned when we checked in we found a child toy in the shower
the hotel was not very responsive to email but rather more responsive via bookingcom
really bad maintained resort location pool very bad rooms out dated i would not recommend this resort at all
the hotel itself was dated and in need of refurbishments the water pressure in the shower was inconsistent it often cut out and the temperature was on the cooper side whilst they tried their best it was difficult at times to communicate with staff
there ware a lot of problem with the room  toilet the window air condition the hotel is not on the main road so the only ay to get a taxi is to order from the hotel and it is always big cars and expensive
the sound of the jacuzzi kept me up all night it was deafening i recorded it to show to the manager but she didn seem gathered for   accommodation i would have expected a little more
the room didn have a bath tub
needs to provide a scuttle service to lamp bathroom need a reap and a proper clean was given different price quotes for the same thing by different staff members which makes one suspicious
the sea and beach close to the hotel were not the best of the island
the beach area is beautiful but is spoiled by plastic bags and rubbish in the water there is an area right next to the bring which is just covered in bags and rubbish in our times of clearing and cleaning up the ocean no one seems to care there there are also no bind at all anywhere either the complex or on the beach
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
the beach bar could do so much better the cocktail took forever to be made prices of drinks there were so much more than the local nearby restaurant
you could have theme parties not just at night but during the day too there just was no entertainment at all it would have been lovely to see some that dancers or traditional entertainment as well as just listening to modern music
breakfast was ok but was exactly the same thing each day
there are areas within the complex which need renovation balconies were very worn some rotten which is worrying especially if you have children the plunge pools should be on times instead of having to call reception to turn them on and off each day the pools need cleaning our pool had a black sum around the water line gutters need emptying when it rains water falls everywhere except where its meant to go
the beds were rock hard i felt like i had slept on the floor each night they looked luxurious until you laid on it
the location quite remote from everything
lots of little things had to ask for hand towels  days in a row blind and light fitting broken in our room breakfast on one day came with bacon  i‚Äôm vegetarian and bacon wasn‚Äôt on the  option i ordered they just took it back to kitchen and scraped off bacon i had a fresh one cooked for me in the end lunchtime penza was awful dry biscuit base tactless and served cold evening meal creamy mushroom past do salt as to be almost incredible
pool area needs work doing broken times and uneven dealing make it a bit hazardous some new pool towels wouldn‚Äôt go amiss either
altogether a bit disappointing
sometimes wifi was a little slow but not an issue
shower was a bit poor and no workers to hold your valuables
its far away from the main street also clot of mosquito
no real separation in the room between the restroom and the main room
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel
the fact there were clot of stray  dogs that looked flea ridden and scared for  this is not a reflection on the hotel but will point out there was a lot of work going on and was really noisy when you sat on balcony and it went on all day so did ruin the quickness of hotel to be honest
the entrance and reception look quite bad the first impression is really important i felt like i‚Äôm in a  stars resort until i saw the roomsome new equipment for the grm will be awesome
there were many rocks in the beach just outside the resort making swimming more difficult we upgrade from our original booking the room booked was called superior double with garden view it was very old small and disappointing as not like the photo on bookingcomor taken many years ago unfortunately  some of the staff spoke and understood only a little english making communication more difficult

expensive food and drinks
i did find the food and drinks more expensive here than surrounding restaurant and bars
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it’s noisy but only till  am
from beginning to end the ark bar was excellent the staff were friendly the rooms were clean food was excellent entertainment and tunes were banging and i wouldn’t hesitate to go there again tomorrow or recommend to all my friends and family
very well managed polite helpful staff the bed was comfortable the room was well designed and the bathroom was great tree bar pool was excellent and just steps to the beach the breakfast included was good quality and ample choice food in the restaurant was good
to food is the best in this hotel
breakfast is standard nothing to shout about but this is the best place to stay if you want to move around for food and shopping  best party by the beach  awesome view and the beach is just down the corner  loved it
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
good location and good food have fun in swimming pool with do all the day
restaurant food is of poor quality lacking that flavor the room is very small and lacks door the price for food and drinks are higher than surrounding areas like next door but guess that is what happens on a resort
the beer and food was about double the price of the restaurant and bars across the road the music was mostly hip hop cap and constant boomboom of speakers everywhere took away from the beautiful beach setting it was a challenge to eat or drink or sit anywhere where there was no smoke my room was non smoking but all the rooms around were not two rooms across from mine had four chain smokers and they sat in front and smoked day and night at night i was approached by a criminal selling bad stuff next to the hotel the beach is not safe at night so dont wander alone on the beach at night
i liked the vagrant atmosphere food good but also surrounded by some amazing restaurant of all cuisines free breakfast is cooked to order on the beach front ark bar is for the young or the old who want to feel young again
best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
the food could have been better
the food is not that great
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
this is best for beach party food and location
room is big and very clean good location if you want to party if you want a quiet night in not a good idea to stay here loud music go on till am then the beach club finished you hear drunk people leaving staffs are friendly food is great party here great worth the money room very clean

we loved everything about the hotel the rooms the food the pool and the beach are all excellent if you want somewhere that’s out of the much more commercial centre of lamp this is an ideal choice you can still get into lamp in under  mind by taxi or rent a sooner
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
very nice boutique hotel very friendly staff very good food the beach is nice but quiet
everything oozes quality  the towels the staff the rooms the robes the food and all the equipment
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
restaurant very delicious food not cheap but worth it
everything is perfectly are religious jew we can not eat the that food so they brought us a big plate of vegetables and fruit to our room very generous it is close  min walk to chased houseexcelent rooms and beach
the place is close to beach and other happening places around good variety of the food nearby and some great bars to have some chill moment the room was not spacious but not too small as well so its an obey
the beach is clean and beautiful  the restaurant has beach view couldn ask for better breakfast spread want big but all the food was taste  swimming pool is a mid size not many people swim so was never crowded  just around the corner from fisherman village which has a big selection of restaurant and shopping stalls on friday and mondaysstaff is very tentative and kind always greet you with smiles
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one
the breakfast selection is huge and excellent we were at the by dinner on saturday night with an excellent selection of food sea food meat and that
lovely hotel beach and pool staff friendly and food very good
very good food with enough variation so you don’t have to go into fisherman’s village

huge apartment nice swimming pool almost without other visitors delicious food in a restaurant cheap and reliable looters to rent close to the centre chewing
the deluge villa with plunge pool was fantastic restaurant nice location with overpriced nice food
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
service and food were amazing loved the view from my room as well as from the pool
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
great views across the beach from dining areas eating and drinking with sand between your toes the swimming pool and dining areas were great this place is an oasis to the rustle and bustle some of the best that food you will ever taste great live music on sundays very comfortable massive beds
the food  staff facility was the best we stayed in the pool villa and we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
excellent food
restaurant for a romantic meal was lovely location great to get around and next to ark bar which was great for a party and flame throws
the hotel had an idyllic setting on the beach with a good infinity pool the italian livid restaurant was on the waters edge and excellent food happy hour was from   pm handy outside but outside hotel very disappointing
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
food breakfast was cold at times variety was lacking
not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food
the hotel restaurant is expensive considering the other ones located next to it and serving same amazing that food
there was no cleanliness during breakfast i saw flies on the food
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden
no drinking water next to the pool and the beach you have to order drinks from the bar kiss are spending many hours on the beach and pool and need to drink a lot i think water cooper should be complementary buying mineral water in large bottles which isn’t expensive even can be done only outside of the resort
food is overpriced very noisy with planes flying over so dont stay here if you want to relax
restaurant and bar are good but really overpriced what is annoying  the prices are shown without tax and service so you have to pay  vat plus   service extra and the service is charged even if you take eg one beer from the beach bar yourself happily there is good beach bar close to the beach with very good food and reasonable prices
the beach was rocky and did not allow for walking along as it didn connect to the rest of the beach as it was blocked by big rocks the food in the restaurant was very average and prices
it looks nothing like the pictures and water running from the tap is yellow the management specially a guy called fabrizio very patronizing and arrogant person who will laugh at your face when you talk said to me the water was safe to use not to drink
what food we tried in our short stay was great i would like to see more that food on menu at least a daily chess special
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
the facilities need some improvement the main pool was missing most of its times and to have some privacy inside the villa you need to close the blackouts even during the day the food is not that great the such was very disappointing felt foggy and not fresh at all and the breakfast option were very limited as well as a wiki beach brand was expecting better
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
food is not so that construction noise above woke us up as early as am
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
lots of little things had to ask for hand towels  days in a row blind and light fitting broken in our room breakfast on one day came with bacon  i’m vegetarian and bacon wasn’t on the  option i ordered they just took it back to kitchen and scraped off bacon i had a fresh one cooked for me in the end lunchtime penza was awful dry biscuit base tactless and served cold evening meal creamy mushroom past do salt as to be almost incredible
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel

we loved everything about the hotel the rooms the food the pool and the beach are all excellent if you want somewhere that’s out of the much more commercial centre of lamp this is an ideal choice you can still get into lamp in under  mind by taxi or rent a sooner
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
very nice boutique hotel very friendly staff very good food the beach is nice but quiet
everything oozes quality  the towels the staff the rooms the robes the food and all the equipment
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
restaurant very delicious food not cheap but worth it
everything is perfectly are religious jew we can not eat the that food so they brought us a big plate of vegetables and fruit to our room very generous it is close  min walk to chased houseexcelent rooms and beach
the place is close to beach and other happening places around good variety of the food nearby and some great bars to have some chill moment the room was not spacious but not too small as well so its an obey
the beach is clean and beautiful  the restaurant has beach view couldn ask for better breakfast spread want big but all the food was taste  swimming pool is a mid size not many people swim so was never crowded  just around the corner from fisherman village which has a big selection of restaurant and shopping stalls on friday and mondaysstaff is very tentative and kind always greet you with smiles
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one
the breakfast selection is huge and excellent we were at the by dinner on saturday night with an excellent selection of food sea food meat and that
lovely hotel beach and pool staff friendly and food very good
very good food with enough variation so you don’t have to go into fisherman’s village

huge apartment nice swimming pool almost without other visitors delicious food in a restaurant cheap and reliable looters to rent close to the centre chewing
the deluge villa with plunge pool was fantastic restaurant nice location with overpriced nice food
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
service and food were amazing loved the view from my room as well as from the pool
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
great views across the beach from dining areas eating and drinking with sand between your toes the swimming pool and dining areas were great this place is an oasis to the rustle and bustle some of the best that food you will ever taste great live music on sundays very comfortable massive beds
the food  staff facility was the best we stayed in the pool villa and we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
excellent food
restaurant for a romantic meal was lovely location great to get around and next to ark bar which was great for a party and flame throws
the hotel had an idyllic setting on the beach with a good infinity pool the italian livid restaurant was on the waters edge and excellent food happy hour was from   pm handy outside but outside hotel very disappointing
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there
food breakfast was cold at times variety was lacking
not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food
the hotel restaurant is expensive considering the other ones located next to it and serving same amazing that food
there was no cleanliness during breakfast i saw flies on the food
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden
no drinking water next to the pool and the beach you have to order drinks from the bar kiss are spending many hours on the beach and pool and need to drink a lot i think water cooper should be complementary buying mineral water in large bottles which isn’t expensive even can be done only outside of the resort
food is overpriced very noisy with planes flying over so dont stay here if you want to relax
restaurant and bar are good but really overpriced what is annoying  the prices are shown without tax and service so you have to pay  vat plus   service extra and the service is charged even if you take eg one beer from the beach bar yourself happily there is good beach bar close to the beach with very good food and reasonable prices
the beach was rocky and did not allow for walking along as it didn connect to the rest of the beach as it was blocked by big rocks the food in the restaurant was very average and prices
it looks nothing like the pictures and water running from the tap is yellow the management specially a guy called fabrizio very patronizing and arrogant person who will laugh at your face when you talk said to me the water was safe to use not to drink
what food we tried in our short stay was great i would like to see more that food on menu at least a daily chess special
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
the facilities need some improvement the main pool was missing most of its times and to have some privacy inside the villa you need to close the blackouts even during the day the food is not that great the such was very disappointing felt foggy and not fresh at all and the breakfast option were very limited as well as a wiki beach brand was expecting better
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
food is not so that construction noise above woke us up as early as am
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
lots of little things had to ask for hand towels  days in a row blind and light fitting broken in our room breakfast on one day came with bacon  i’m vegetarian and bacon wasn’t on the  option i ordered they just took it back to kitchen and scraped off bacon i had a fresh one cooked for me in the end lunchtime penza was awful dry biscuit base tactless and served cold evening meal creamy mushroom past do salt as to be almost incredible
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel

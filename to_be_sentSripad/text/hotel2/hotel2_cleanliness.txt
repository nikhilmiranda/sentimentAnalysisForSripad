the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
spacious clean room comfortable bed good breakfast
the pool access villa was nice room  very clean the lap pool was lovely to swim staff in restaurant were very  friendly it was always nice to see noun  rook from the restaurant as they were always happy  welcoming
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn’t be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
the breakfast was awful cold fried eggs cold baconnot very clean we paid over £ per night to stay hear and it was very  disappointing
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
breakfast more asia foods and cook bacon fresh
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities
it was a bit grim the cleaner didn’t clean the rooms very well
on a couple of occasions the water cut out  and i would recommend the apartment have brush for sweeping and something to clean with so we can keep tidy
bed sheets could be fresh
bathroom not clean hair around the apartment floor had not been swept
bedroom  bathroom was not very clean and dated   bedding was very dated  definitely needs an upgrade hotel has  upper floors with no lift  only stairs quite a mission to drag up a heavy suitcase  although the belly brought up our cases  it was a mission going down on check out

although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
the breakfast was awful cold fried eggs cold baconnot very clean we paid over £ per night to stay hear and it was very  disappointing
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
breakfast more asia foods and cook bacon fresh
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities
it was a bit grim the cleaner didn’t clean the rooms very well
on a couple of occasions the water cut out  and i would recommend the apartment have brush for sweeping and something to clean with so we can keep tidy
bed sheets could be fresh
bathroom not clean hair around the apartment floor had not been swept
bedroom  bathroom was not very clean and dated   bedding was very dated  definitely needs an upgrade hotel has  upper floors with no lift  only stairs quite a mission to drag up a heavy suitcase  although the belly brought up our cases  it was a mission going down on check out
the facilities need some improvement the main pool was missing most of its times and to have some privacy inside the villa you need to close the blackouts even during the day the food is not that great the such was very disappointing felt foggy and not fresh at all and the breakfast option were very limited as well as a wiki beach brand was expecting better
wifi never worked during our three night stay the villa we booked was actually one half of a villa with no noise drooping we could literally hear the conversations in the next room cleanliness was a miss the villa or the room actually didn appear very clean breakfast had very little option and most of the times were not filled when anything finished in the buffets
things you will hatemosquitoes are everywhere you will start to stay at room to escape from crazy mosquitoes or you will scratch yourself by bleeding if you are brave enough to stay outsidehumidity level is crazy you will see  at nights and will sweat as hellsea temperature is higher than weather so taking shower is fresh way than swimmingany price you will see is not vat included they do not add in total taxes to price lists on venus or their offer
the whole villa smelt extremely dusty upon arrival and although it looked completely clean it smelt unclean it was also extremely dated and is desperate for a return wouldn’t personally stay here again but was okay for what we needed it for
needs to provide a scuttle service to lamp bathroom need a reap and a proper clean was given different price quotes for the same thing by different staff members which makes one suspicious
lots of little things had to ask for hand towels  days in a row blind and light fitting broken in our room breakfast on one day came with bacon  i’m vegetarian and bacon wasn’t on the  option i ordered they just took it back to kitchen and scraped off bacon i had a fresh one cooked for me in the end lunchtime penza was awful dry biscuit base tactless and served cold evening meal creamy mushroom past do salt as to be almost incredible

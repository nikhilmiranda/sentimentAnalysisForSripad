i really can‚Äôt think of anything that i didn‚Äôt like  this place is just simply amazing
this place is one of the best hotels to stay at in fact you‚Äôll see people from other hotels paying and coming over for poolparty at arbat
great beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
location cleanliness pools access to the beach and parties
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it‚Äôs noisy but only till  am
the location is great  your right near a ton of shopping in same and the property is right on the beach and has great poolbeach bars the  pools are pretty nice and there is a good music vice
location is very goodfriendly staffcomfortable rooms
best location on the island specially if you like an active stay  also they throw the best beach parties
best place you cannot dislike anything
i definitely liked the location and accommodation in my opinion this hotel was a good value for the money 
if your not into loud music then this is not a place where you would want to stay
location was the best asset
location
as a female travelling alone  being in the business spot meant that i felt safe going out  either to the street nighttime or beach party    i did not need to catch any public transport home or be alone and vulnerable at night
good location helpful staff
no hot water chair was to low to sit and use computerbathroom looked great but didn function shelling or place to keep your stuff  air conditioned was right over the bed and at its lowest it was blasting freezing cold hair on the bedcould not sleep with it onto cold  each time i woke up sweating sat on the couch and let it run for ten unturned it off and went back to bed  the art of all design is functionality its one thing for stuff to look great but if it doesn serve the purpose then it fails they must think in terms of people actually using the roomsthey were large well done nice bed lots of plugs and a big balconythink about what people do in the rooms besides look at them in in worse in among at the moment and i wish i had stayed in same at the ark is in a trained interior and theatre designer retired
everything is pretty good here good spot for young people nice pools and beach loud music and fire displays on the beach i wouldn stay here with young kiss as music is banging on until am i would stay here again this was my nd time at arbat
clean and good location
excellent value hotel is straight on the beach it has  pools and restaurant on the beach with very reasonable prices there is an awesome night beach party every wednesday and friday rooms are also nice everything you need for a great stay in right in the resort however there is a party all day long do i do not recommend these place for nonparty people overall great value and great stay in oh same

the team from the location
great location directly on the beach poolparties
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn‚Äôt an issue you should know you‚Äôre getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
these guns have it down to a science since they move so many people in and out very efficient extremely clean pool was fantastic and beach access was steps away highlight of our trip was lounging poolside and the fire shows great place to visit and explore the rest of the island too
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
there is nothing not to love about this place
breakfast is standard nothing to shout about but this is the best place to stay if you want to move around for food and shopping  best party by the beach  awesome view and the beach is just down the corner  loved it
location was far beach parties were good great hotel and a fair price would definitely stay again
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful

best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that‚Äôs to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
location and facilities
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
best place to stay if you want to party always busy and fun great location would still stay again  great place to mingle
location

my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
beautiful beach and pools really nice garden with superb flowers and plants great breakfast and pool bar service close to the main street but still quiet place
location and price
the pool area is a great spot to relax and have cocktail
good location
privacy of the villa was great   wonderful view  quit place for relaxing
nice place with good breakfast
beautiful rooms and resort amazing beach very clean good location in between chewing and bout
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
great location only a little outside the nighttime area
nice and quiet beach nice relaxing area at the pool restaurant with beautiful sea view free karay will fit only to old people and families with small children
the location was perfect within walking distances to everything and staff at reception where really friendly and pan at reservation was very helpful and great
nice door was surprised that my room came with an outdoor jacuzzi at the balcony multiple pools and one that faces the sunset was not crowded during my stay great place to stay for a very reasonable price
in afraid this place has ruined all other hotels for me in the future  nothing can compare to the tongs bay experience everything beginning with checking and ending in checkout was perfect service
poolside area is comfortable  ample poolbeds the towels feel great the shower work well the poolside staff are attentive helpful
the hotel is located right on the beach the beach is perfect clean sand blue water the hotel is fearlessly integrated into nature situated on a slope above the beach the views are breathtaking its a lot of fun to observe the wildlife inside the hotel area lots of birds and caterpillars
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
the location
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
small boutique hotel modern clean design good location amazing beach very good breakfast
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
the staff were just far so lovely and friendly the location is very central the beach is just beautiful and we stayed in a garden villa which was divine
perfect service wonderful location everything really  star level
i don‚Äôt think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i‚Äôve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
views and relaxing place
quiet location with no hawkers bothering you you can hand feed the tropical fish in the sea nice big bungalow very clean room staff were friendly and sir management were very helpful excellent value for what we paid
amazing location on lovely swimming beach friendly professional
great value great location
great staff  peaceful and relaxing accommodations  superior location  we felt very well cared for from the moment we arrived until our departure  highly recommend
basic but in a great location literally on the beach nighttime and bars are in walking distance but far away enough that the ones around you are a bit cheaper the two women who work on reception are sooooo funny and kind made my stay a million times better thank you
the location is right on the beach  exactly how it appears in the photo  and it is a short walk albeit up a slight hill to get to the nearest shops and restaurant
good place
the location just  minutes walk to the fisherman‚Äôs village the privacy of the villa i booked
receptionists very friendly and helpful organized my travel to oh to nice view from the backside over beach and bout area and good to chill out
the architectural and artistic theme was good pleasant feel to the place
accommodation spot on right on the beach and next to pool could not fault
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don‚Äôt want to travel as backpackers but don‚Äôt want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the place is close to beach and other happening places around good variety of the food nearby and some great bars to have some chill moment the room was not spacious but not too small as well so its an obey
beautiful place big swimming pool quite place just a few minutes from fisherman village we also rent a motor bike for a good price big bedroom
the location is really convenient as it was very close to the airport main pier and some of the more tourist areas in same like he fisherman village and the big buddha
good location
the dermoid resort is so beautiful it is perfect place to enjoy your holidays it has two wonderful swinmingpools and the beach is also where the resort is you have just to down one step the rooms are very comfortable too
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
this should be a  star hotel the staff were so friendly the breakfast was really good the rooms were clean location is perfect  would recommend
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
location is so great easy to the beach and the street people working here are so nice i will recommend to my friends if they come here for vacation
fabulous hotel spacious rooms and bathroom large come beds good air con immaculate gardens lovely pool area beach bar happy hour  superb breakfast worth booking a deluge roomvilla as these are located away from the very busy main road great beachside location quiet a little piece of paradise would love to return
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
nice beach great location good service best massage ever

my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
i don‚Äôt understand all the negative reviews at all we stayed for  nights and enjoyed every second of it the place is right onto may am beach with a bar lounge chairs hanging chair a shower and a pool in the morning a good breakfast is served with amazing beachsea views the room itself is small but copy and we had enough space for our luggage they provided shower towels and beach towels which are changed every day we also rented a motorbike as this is the best way to explore the islandlastly the hotel is located in chinatown so there are many shops and restaurant located only  min away on thursday the nearby shopping street turns into a lively nightmare a must go
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
directly opposite of the green mange road  leisure area
beautiful experience and beautiful place
nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the location is amazing the stuff is extremely friendly the hotel is exactly on the beach with beds
the deluge villa with plunge pool was fantastic restaurant nice location with overpriced nice food
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
the location close to chewing walking street
the rooms staff and the location
good location really friendly staff nice big clean room
the location of the hotel is great as it is directly on the beach the breakfast was nice and the rooms and grounds were always clean however if you want a quieter stay i suggest staying away from chewing and staying in bout
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
great beach front rooms in a great location at the quiet end of chewing lowed the sea and the romantic feel of the that style rooms and the kiss loved the modern style room
location just far enough to enjoy the busy beach but also enjoy the peaceful beach different evenings the hotel put on
the property was in a perfect location such good value for money and amazing views
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
place amazing sex go back longer than  month
great views across the beach from dining areas eating and drinking with sand between your toes the swimming pool and dining areas were great this place is an oasis to the rustle and bustle some of the best that food you will ever taste great live music on sundays very comfortable massive beds
we really liked the swimming pool and the location the resort has an overall luxury feeling and is well maintained
great location and value for money the kiss loved the pool
worst bed in the world rooms were not cleaned till  pm hotel was not expecting us on our arrival shocking most guests around pool area was from a sister hotel
nice location next to the fisherman‚Äôs village but still quiet for the night good rooms and sea area
rooms are spacious nice pool area and situated quieter end of chewing
location very good  lovely pool area
room excellent and location close to beach and shopping area
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
location honest staff  very helpful
restaurant for a romantic meal was lovely location great to get around and next to ark bar which was great for a party and flame throws
comfortable location
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
my wifi and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn‚Äôt be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the resort is in a jungle style location therefore there are a lot of mosquitoes and it is not good that the windows in the rooms are not closing perfectly
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
sadly the electricity generations are very noisy during the day its not the property fault but its unfortunate location is very quiet and a bit empty in this season but good for those couples who just want to lay at the pool less suited for solo travellers
location slight walk into town but worth it for the place you get construction going on down by the pool at the moment but no big deal
the location is far from town center
it is little difficult to find taxi beside the road not always they are going the way you anna go almost all the famous reaches and sights are a bit far from this place that the only thing we dint like about this place
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states ‚Äúairport scuttle‚Äù which is not free description states ‚Äúcanning‚Äù but that is not offered at the hotel
when we arrived we were very disappointed at the state of the room it was very old and bathroom were gross beds were so hard and the place just looked run down we couldn‚Äôt stay there so we booked another hotel down the road
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden
very bad location no delivered we tried at
depending on where your room is located you will either have a generous sized ratio area or a smaller one
the whole decorations of the hotel the rooms receptions where not too nice i really was expecting a fancier place they put more effort in the party and bars rather than the hotel and rooms
needs a kiss menu as in all other things it‚Äôs a great place for children
was slightly noisy due to its location but only a minor issue
after i complained and we were checking out there were adding or replacing active carbon the their water maybe didn have any in the first place you can see in the pictures
i had more pictures but not on my phone to highlight the lack of maintenance in this place
one downside was the beach it was frankly dirty the other was the location  it was not close to anything
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional ¬£ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don‚Äôt release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they‚Äôre all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn‚Äôt have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn‚Äôt need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn‚Äôt go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that‚Äôs all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
rooms not amazing quality but nice enough pool lounge area quite small
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
fantastic place so quiet and pictures
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
we stayed in  rooms   and   in rooms  and  there was a distinct drainage smell  which was very unpleasant for our entire stay  we also had numerous mosquitoes in our room  other than that it was a beautiful place and we enjoyed our stay
location is a bit isolated but it was very relaxed and had a good vice if someone is looking to stay out of main crowded areas its perfect
really bad maintained resort location pool very bad rooms out dated i would not recommend this resort at all
the beach area is beautiful but is spoiled by plastic bags and rubbish in the water there is an area right next to the bring which is just covered in bags and rubbish in our times of clearing and cleaning up the ocean no one seems to care there there are also no bind at all anywhere either the complex or on the beach
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
the location quite remote from everything
pool area needs work doing broken times and uneven dealing make it a bit hazardous some new pool towels wouldn‚Äôt go amiss either
i really can‚Äôt think of anything that i didn‚Äôt like  this place is just simply amazing
this place is one of the best hotels to stay at in fact you‚Äôll see people from other hotels paying and coming over for poolparty at arbat
great beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
location cleanliness pools access to the beach and parties
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it‚Äôs noisy but only till  am
the location is great  your right near a ton of shopping in same and the property is right on the beach and has great poolbeach bars the  pools are pretty nice and there is a good music vice
location is very goodfriendly staffcomfortable rooms
best location on the island specially if you like an active stay  also they throw the best beach parties
best place you cannot dislike anything
i definitely liked the location and accommodation in my opinion this hotel was a good value for the money 
if your not into loud music then this is not a place where you would want to stay
location was the best asset
location
as a female travelling alone  being in the business spot meant that i felt safe going out  either to the street nighttime or beach party    i did not need to catch any public transport home or be alone and vulnerable at night
good location helpful staff
no hot water chair was to low to sit and use computerbathroom looked great but didn function shelling or place to keep your stuff  air conditioned was right over the bed and at its lowest it was blasting freezing cold hair on the bedcould not sleep with it onto cold  each time i woke up sweating sat on the couch and let it run for ten unturned it off and went back to bed  the art of all design is functionality its one thing for stuff to look great but if it doesn serve the purpose then it fails they must think in terms of people actually using the roomsthey were large well done nice bed lots of plugs and a big balconythink about what people do in the rooms besides look at them in in worse in among at the moment and i wish i had stayed in same at the ark is in a trained interior and theatre designer retired
everything is pretty good here good spot for young people nice pools and beach loud music and fire displays on the beach i wouldn stay here with young kiss as music is banging on until am i would stay here again this was my nd time at arbat
clean and good location
excellent value hotel is straight on the beach it has  pools and restaurant on the beach with very reasonable prices there is an awesome night beach party every wednesday and friday rooms are also nice everything you need for a great stay in right in the resort however there is a party all day long do i do not recommend these place for nonparty people overall great value and great stay in oh same

location
the team from the location
great location directly on the beach poolparties
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn‚Äôt an issue you should know you‚Äôre getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
these guns have it down to a science since they move so many people in and out very efficient extremely clean pool was fantastic and beach access was steps away highlight of our trip was lounging poolside and the fire shows great place to visit and explore the rest of the island too
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
there is nothing not to love about this place
breakfast is standard nothing to shout about but this is the best place to stay if you want to move around for food and shopping  best party by the beach  awesome view and the beach is just down the corner  loved it
location was far beach parties were good great hotel and a fair price would definitely stay again
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful

best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step

brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that‚Äôs to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
location and facilities
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
best place to stay if you want to party always busy and fun great location would still stay again  great place to mingle

beautiful beach and pools really nice garden with superb flowers and plants great breakfast and pool bar service close to the main street but still quiet place
location and price
the pool area is a great spot to relax and have cocktail
good location
privacy of the villa was great   wonderful view  quit place for relaxing
nice place with good breakfast
beautiful rooms and resort amazing beach very clean good location in between chewing and bout
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
great location only a little outside the nighttime area
nice and quiet beach nice relaxing area at the pool restaurant with beautiful sea view free karay will fit only to old people and families with small children
the location was perfect within walking distances to everything and staff at reception where really friendly and pan at reservation was very helpful and great
nice door was surprised that my room came with an outdoor jacuzzi at the balcony multiple pools and one that faces the sunset was not crowded during my stay great place to stay for a very reasonable price
in afraid this place has ruined all other hotels for me in the future  nothing can compare to the tongs bay experience everything beginning with checking and ending in checkout was perfect service
poolside area is comfortable  ample poolbeds the towels feel great the shower work well the poolside staff are attentive helpful
the hotel is located right on the beach the beach is perfect clean sand blue water the hotel is fearlessly integrated into nature situated on a slope above the beach the views are breathtaking its a lot of fun to observe the wildlife inside the hotel area lots of birds and caterpillars
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
the location
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
small boutique hotel modern clean design good location amazing beach very good breakfast
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
the staff were just far so lovely and friendly the location is very central the beach is just beautiful and we stayed in a garden villa which was divine
perfect service wonderful location everything really  star level
i don‚Äôt think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i‚Äôve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
views and relaxing place
quiet location with no hawkers bothering you you can hand feed the tropical fish in the sea nice big bungalow very clean room staff were friendly and sir management were very helpful excellent value for what we paid
amazing location on lovely swimming beach friendly professional
great value great location
great staff  peaceful and relaxing accommodations  superior location  we felt very well cared for from the moment we arrived until our departure  highly recommend
basic but in a great location literally on the beach nighttime and bars are in walking distance but far away enough that the ones around you are a bit cheaper the two women who work on reception are sooooo funny and kind made my stay a million times better thank you
the location is right on the beach  exactly how it appears in the photo  and it is a short walk albeit up a slight hill to get to the nearest shops and restaurant
good place
the location just  minutes walk to the fisherman‚Äôs village the privacy of the villa i booked
receptionists very friendly and helpful organized my travel to oh to nice view from the backside over beach and bout area and good to chill out
the architectural and artistic theme was good pleasant feel to the place
accommodation spot on right on the beach and next to pool could not fault
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don‚Äôt want to travel as backpackers but don‚Äôt want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the place is close to beach and other happening places around good variety of the food nearby and some great bars to have some chill moment the room was not spacious but not too small as well so its an obey
beautiful place big swimming pool quite place just a few minutes from fisherman village we also rent a motor bike for a good price big bedroom
the location is really convenient as it was very close to the airport main pier and some of the more tourist areas in same like he fisherman village and the big buddha
good location
the dermoid resort is so beautiful it is perfect place to enjoy your holidays it has two wonderful swinmingpools and the beach is also where the resort is you have just to down one step the rooms are very comfortable too
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
this should be a  star hotel the staff were so friendly the breakfast was really good the rooms were clean location is perfect  would recommend
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
location is so great easy to the beach and the street people working here are so nice i will recommend to my friends if they come here for vacation
fabulous hotel spacious rooms and bathroom large come beds good air con immaculate gardens lovely pool area beach bar happy hour  superb breakfast worth booking a deluge roomvilla as these are located away from the very busy main road great beachside location quiet a little piece of paradise would love to return
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties

fantastic location  huge room and nice pool
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
i don‚Äôt understand all the negative reviews at all we stayed for  nights and enjoyed every second of it the place is right onto may am beach with a bar lounge chairs hanging chair a shower and a pool in the morning a good breakfast is served with amazing beachsea views the room itself is small but copy and we had enough space for our luggage they provided shower towels and beach towels which are changed every day we also rented a motorbike as this is the best way to explore the islandlastly the hotel is located in chinatown so there are many shops and restaurant located only  min away on thursday the nearby shopping street turns into a lively nightmare a must go
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
directly opposite of the green mange road  leisure area
beautiful experience and beautiful place
nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the location is amazing the stuff is extremely friendly the hotel is exactly on the beach with beds
the deluge villa with plunge pool was fantastic restaurant nice location with overpriced nice food
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
the location close to chewing walking street
the rooms staff and the location
good location really friendly staff nice big clean room
the location of the hotel is great as it is directly on the beach the breakfast was nice and the rooms and grounds were always clean however if you want a quieter stay i suggest staying away from chewing and staying in bout
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
great beach front rooms in a great location at the quiet end of chewing lowed the sea and the romantic feel of the that style rooms and the kiss loved the modern style room
location just far enough to enjoy the busy beach but also enjoy the peaceful beach different evenings the hotel put on
the property was in a perfect location such good value for money and amazing views
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
place amazing sex go back longer than  month
great views across the beach from dining areas eating and drinking with sand between your toes the swimming pool and dining areas were great this place is an oasis to the rustle and bustle some of the best that food you will ever taste great live music on sundays very comfortable massive beds
we really liked the swimming pool and the location the resort has an overall luxury feeling and is well maintained
great location and value for money the kiss loved the pool
worst bed in the world rooms were not cleaned till  pm hotel was not expecting us on our arrival shocking most guests around pool area was from a sister hotel
nice location next to the fisherman‚Äôs village but still quiet for the night good rooms and sea area
rooms are spacious nice pool area and situated quieter end of chewing
location very good  lovely pool area
room excellent and location close to beach and shopping area
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
location honest staff  very helpful
restaurant for a romantic meal was lovely location great to get around and next to ark bar which was great for a party and flame throws
comfortable location
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
my wifi and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn‚Äôt be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the resort is in a jungle style location therefore there are a lot of mosquitoes and it is not good that the windows in the rooms are not closing perfectly
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
sadly the electricity generations are very noisy during the day its not the property fault but its unfortunate location is very quiet and a bit empty in this season but good for those couples who just want to lay at the pool less suited for solo travellers
location slight walk into town but worth it for the place you get construction going on down by the pool at the moment but no big deal
the location is far from town center
it is little difficult to find taxi beside the road not always they are going the way you anna go almost all the famous reaches and sights are a bit far from this place that the only thing we dint like about this place
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states ‚Äúairport scuttle‚Äù which is not free description states ‚Äúcanning‚Äù but that is not offered at the hotel
when we arrived we were very disappointed at the state of the room it was very old and bathroom were gross beds were so hard and the place just looked run down we couldn‚Äôt stay there so we booked another hotel down the road
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden
very bad location no delivered we tried at
depending on where your room is located you will either have a generous sized ratio area or a smaller one
the whole decorations of the hotel the rooms receptions where not too nice i really was expecting a fancier place they put more effort in the party and bars rather than the hotel and rooms
needs a kiss menu as in all other things it‚Äôs a great place for children
was slightly noisy due to its location but only a minor issue
after i complained and we were checking out there were adding or replacing active carbon the their water maybe didn have any in the first place you can see in the pictures
i had more pictures but not on my phone to highlight the lack of maintenance in this place
one downside was the beach it was frankly dirty the other was the location  it was not close to anything
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional ¬£ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don‚Äôt release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they‚Äôre all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn‚Äôt have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn‚Äôt need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn‚Äôt go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that‚Äôs all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
rooms not amazing quality but nice enough pool lounge area quite small
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
fantastic place so quiet and pictures
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
we stayed in  rooms   and   in rooms  and  there was a distinct drainage smell  which was very unpleasant for our entire stay  we also had numerous mosquitoes in our room  other than that it was a beautiful place and we enjoyed our stay
location is a bit isolated but it was very relaxed and had a good vice if someone is looking to stay out of main crowded areas its perfect
really bad maintained resort location pool very bad rooms out dated i would not recommend this resort at all
the beach area is beautiful but is spoiled by plastic bags and rubbish in the water there is an area right next to the bring which is just covered in bags and rubbish in our times of clearing and cleaning up the ocean no one seems to care there there are also no bind at all anywhere either the complex or on the beach
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
the location quite remote from everything
pool area needs work doing broken times and uneven dealing make it a bit hazardous some new pool towels wouldn‚Äôt go amiss either
i really can‚Äôt think of anything that i didn‚Äôt like  this place is just simply amazing
this place is one of the best hotels to stay at in fact you‚Äôll see people from other hotels paying and coming over for poolparty at arbat
great beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
location cleanliness pools access to the beach and parties
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it‚Äôs noisy but only till  am
the location is great  your right near a ton of shopping in same and the property is right on the beach and has great poolbeach bars the  pools are pretty nice and there is a good music vice
location is very goodfriendly staffcomfortable rooms
best location on the island specially if you like an active stay  also they throw the best beach parties
best place you cannot dislike anything
i definitely liked the location and accommodation in my opinion this hotel was a good value for the money 
if your not into loud music then this is not a place where you would want to stay
location was the best asset
location
as a female travelling alone  being in the business spot meant that i felt safe going out  either to the street nighttime or beach party    i did not need to catch any public transport home or be alone and vulnerable at night
good location helpful staff
no hot water chair was to low to sit and use computerbathroom looked great but didn function shelling or place to keep your stuff  air conditioned was right over the bed and at its lowest it was blasting freezing cold hair on the bedcould not sleep with it onto cold  each time i woke up sweating sat on the couch and let it run for ten unturned it off and went back to bed  the art of all design is functionality its one thing for stuff to look great but if it doesn serve the purpose then it fails they must think in terms of people actually using the roomsthey were large well done nice bed lots of plugs and a big balconythink about what people do in the rooms besides look at them in in worse in among at the moment and i wish i had stayed in same at the ark is in a trained interior and theatre designer retired
everything is pretty good here good spot for young people nice pools and beach loud music and fire displays on the beach i wouldn stay here with young kiss as music is banging on until am i would stay here again this was my nd time at arbat
clean and good location
excellent value hotel is straight on the beach it has  pools and restaurant on the beach with very reasonable prices there is an awesome night beach party every wednesday and friday rooms are also nice everything you need for a great stay in right in the resort however there is a party all day long do i do not recommend these place for nonparty people overall great value and great stay in oh same

its so close to the beach yet the place was kept clean n tidy from beach sands
high voices difficulty to sleep its place for people who likes to party but not for me
location
the team from the location
great location directly on the beach poolparties
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn‚Äôt an issue you should know you‚Äôre getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
these guns have it down to a science since they move so many people in and out very efficient extremely clean pool was fantastic and beach access was steps away highlight of our trip was lounging poolside and the fire shows great place to visit and explore the rest of the island too
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
there is nothing not to love about this place
breakfast is standard nothing to shout about but this is the best place to stay if you want to move around for food and shopping  best party by the beach  awesome view and the beach is just down the corner  loved it
location was far beach parties were good great hotel and a fair price would definitely stay again
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful

best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step

brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that‚Äôs to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend
location and facilities
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great

beautiful beach and pools really nice garden with superb flowers and plants great breakfast and pool bar service close to the main street but still quiet place
location and price
the pool area is a great spot to relax and have cocktail
good location
privacy of the villa was great   wonderful view  quit place for relaxing
nice place with good breakfast
beautiful rooms and resort amazing beach very clean good location in between chewing and bout
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
great location only a little outside the nighttime area
nice and quiet beach nice relaxing area at the pool restaurant with beautiful sea view free karay will fit only to old people and families with small children
the location was perfect within walking distances to everything and staff at reception where really friendly and pan at reservation was very helpful and great
nice door was surprised that my room came with an outdoor jacuzzi at the balcony multiple pools and one that faces the sunset was not crowded during my stay great place to stay for a very reasonable price
in afraid this place has ruined all other hotels for me in the future  nothing can compare to the tongs bay experience everything beginning with checking and ending in checkout was perfect service
poolside area is comfortable  ample poolbeds the towels feel great the shower work well the poolside staff are attentive helpful
the hotel is located right on the beach the beach is perfect clean sand blue water the hotel is fearlessly integrated into nature situated on a slope above the beach the views are breathtaking its a lot of fun to observe the wildlife inside the hotel area lots of birds and caterpillars
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
the location
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
small boutique hotel modern clean design good location amazing beach very good breakfast
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
the staff were just far so lovely and friendly the location is very central the beach is just beautiful and we stayed in a garden villa which was divine
perfect service wonderful location everything really  star level
i don‚Äôt think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i‚Äôve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you

great value great location
great staff  peaceful and relaxing accommodations  superior location  we felt very well cared for from the moment we arrived until our departure  highly recommend
basic but in a great location literally on the beach nighttime and bars are in walking distance but far away enough that the ones around you are a bit cheaper the two women who work on reception are sooooo funny and kind made my stay a million times better thank you
the location is right on the beach  exactly how it appears in the photo  and it is a short walk albeit up a slight hill to get to the nearest shops and restaurant
good place
the location just  minutes walk to the fisherman‚Äôs village the privacy of the villa i booked
receptionists very friendly and helpful organized my travel to oh to nice view from the backside over beach and bout area and good to chill out
the architectural and artistic theme was good pleasant feel to the place
accommodation spot on right on the beach and next to pool could not fault
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don‚Äôt want to travel as backpackers but don‚Äôt want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the place is close to beach and other happening places around good variety of the food nearby and some great bars to have some chill moment the room was not spacious but not too small as well so its an obey
beautiful place big swimming pool quite place just a few minutes from fisherman village we also rent a motor bike for a good price big bedroom
the location is really convenient as it was very close to the airport main pier and some of the more tourist areas in same like he fisherman village and the big buddha
good location
the dermoid resort is so beautiful it is perfect place to enjoy your holidays it has two wonderful swinmingpools and the beach is also where the resort is you have just to down one step the rooms are very comfortable too
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
this should be a  star hotel the staff were so friendly the breakfast was really good the rooms were clean location is perfect  would recommend
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
location is so great easy to the beach and the street people working here are so nice i will recommend to my friends if they come here for vacation
fabulous hotel spacious rooms and bathroom large come beds good air con immaculate gardens lovely pool area beach bar happy hour  superb breakfast worth booking a deluge roomvilla as these are located away from the very busy main road great beachside location quiet a little piece of paradise would love to return
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties

my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren‚Äôt staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
i don‚Äôt understand all the negative reviews at all we stayed for  nights and enjoyed every second of it the place is right onto may am beach with a bar lounge chairs hanging chair a shower and a pool in the morning a good breakfast is served with amazing beachsea views the room itself is small but copy and we had enough space for our luggage they provided shower towels and beach towels which are changed every day we also rented a motorbike as this is the best way to explore the islandlastly the hotel is located in chinatown so there are many shops and restaurant located only  min away on thursday the nearby shopping street turns into a lively nightmare a must go
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
directly opposite of the green mange road  leisure area
beautiful experience and beautiful place
nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the location is amazing the stuff is extremely friendly the hotel is exactly on the beach with beds
the deluge villa with plunge pool was fantastic restaurant nice location with overpriced nice food
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
the location close to chewing walking street
the rooms staff and the location
good location really friendly staff nice big clean room
the location of the hotel is great as it is directly on the beach the breakfast was nice and the rooms and grounds were always clean however if you want a quieter stay i suggest staying away from chewing and staying in bout
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
great beach front rooms in a great location at the quiet end of chewing lowed the sea and the romantic feel of the that style rooms and the kiss loved the modern style room
location just far enough to enjoy the busy beach but also enjoy the peaceful beach different evenings the hotel put on
the property was in a perfect location such good value for money and amazing views
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
place amazing sex go back longer than  month
great views across the beach from dining areas eating and drinking with sand between your toes the swimming pool and dining areas were great this place is an oasis to the rustle and bustle some of the best that food you will ever taste great live music on sundays very comfortable massive beds
we really liked the swimming pool and the location the resort has an overall luxury feeling and is well maintained
great location and value for money the kiss loved the pool
worst bed in the world rooms were not cleaned till  pm hotel was not expecting us on our arrival shocking most guests around pool area was from a sister hotel
nice location next to the fisherman‚Äôs village but still quiet for the night good rooms and sea area
rooms are spacious nice pool area and situated quieter end of chewing
location very good  lovely pool area
room excellent and location close to beach and shopping area
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
location honest staff  very helpful
restaurant for a romantic meal was lovely location great to get around and next to ark bar which was great for a party and flame throws
comfortable location
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
my wifi and i hadn booked for our son as he joined the last minute so they arranged a spare bed great sea view and location for restaurant shopping breakfast menu was good and the coffee great will definitely come here again
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn‚Äôt be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the resort is in a jungle style location therefore there are a lot of mosquitoes and it is not good that the windows in the rooms are not closing perfectly
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
sadly the electricity generations are very noisy during the day its not the property fault but its unfortunate location is very quiet and a bit empty in this season but good for those couples who just want to lay at the pool less suited for solo travellers
location slight walk into town but worth it for the place you get construction going on down by the pool at the moment but no big deal
the location is far from town center
it is little difficult to find taxi beside the road not always they are going the way you anna go almost all the famous reaches and sights are a bit far from this place that the only thing we dint like about this place
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wifi we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren‚Äôt clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn‚Äôt want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states ‚Äúairport scuttle‚Äù which is not free description states ‚Äúcanning‚Äù but that is not offered at the hotel
when we arrived we were very disappointed at the state of the room it was very old and bathroom were gross beds were so hard and the place just looked run down we couldn‚Äôt stay there so we booked another hotel down the road
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden
very bad location no delivered we tried at
depending on where your room is located you will either have a generous sized ratio area or a smaller one
the whole decorations of the hotel the rooms receptions where not too nice i really was expecting a fancier place they put more effort in the party and bars rather than the hotel and rooms
needs a kiss menu as in all other things it‚Äôs a great place for children
was slightly noisy due to its location but only a minor issue
after i complained and we were checking out there were adding or replacing active carbon the their water maybe didn have any in the first place you can see in the pictures
i had more pictures but not on my phone to highlight the lack of maintenance in this place
one downside was the beach it was frankly dirty the other was the location  it was not close to anything
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional ¬£ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don‚Äôt release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they‚Äôre all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn‚Äôt have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn‚Äôt need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn‚Äôt go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that‚Äôs all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
rooms not amazing quality but nice enough pool lounge area quite small
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
fantastic place so quiet and pictures
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
we stayed in  rooms   and   in rooms  and  there was a distinct drainage smell  which was very unpleasant for our entire stay  we also had numerous mosquitoes in our room  other than that it was a beautiful place and we enjoyed our stay
location is a bit isolated but it was very relaxed and had a good vice if someone is looking to stay out of main crowded areas its perfect
really bad maintained resort location pool very bad rooms out dated i would not recommend this resort at all
the beach area is beautiful but is spoiled by plastic bags and rubbish in the water there is an area right next to the bring which is just covered in bags and rubbish in our times of clearing and cleaning up the ocean no one seems to care there there are also no bind at all anywhere either the complex or on the beach
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space
the location quite remote from everything
pool area needs work doing broken times and uneven dealing make it a bit hazardous some new pool towels wouldn‚Äôt go amiss either

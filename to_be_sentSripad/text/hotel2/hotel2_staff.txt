great beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it’s noisy but only till  am
first of all its not really a party until pm  dont expect the pm pool party to be crazy its mostly families the staff are super strict on the rules  you only get one towel with your key cards per day which they dont tell you also the power annoying shuts off whenever you take the key out of the room which is good for the hotel to save power but really annoying when its  degrees f and your room is boiling hot because the ac shuts off every single time you leave
very well trained staff and excellent service  precise and professional
the staff
good location helpful staff
from beginning to end the ark bar was excellent the staff were friendly the rooms were clean food was excellent entertainment and tunes were banging and i wouldn’t hesitate to go there again tomorrow or recommend to all my friends and family
the hotel is lovely location beautiful facilities and nice live gathers and friendly staff
close to main area in chewing staff is polite
no hot water in the shower the staff wasn’t nice and attentive they didn’t listen to the problem and didn’t fix it we showered in cold water throughout the stay
the position of the hotel and it offers a great night out with fantastic staff
ideal location excellent staff and very clean
very well managed polite helpful staff the bed was comfortable the room was well designed and the bathroom was great tree bar pool was excellent and just steps to the beach the breakfast included was good quality and ample choice food in the restaurant was good
the team from the location
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the hotel is really nice location and also very friendly staff with all the facilities under one roof also the hotel allowed us an early check in co of availability and the request for late check out was offered with a normal fee till  in evening as we had a late flight
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
good location right on beach front close to most stuff  airport  piers for if you’re moving to other oh islands rooms were spacious also staff were good lively at night with a lot going on fire shows dancers etc
harry and his team at reception did a fantastic job super friendly and will to assist wherever possible the hotel is rewarded with great staff housekeeping did a great job along with the bar and restaurant staff great place for the young at heart party all day from  am
behaviour of the reception staff
reception staff  not so helpful and courteous
hotel was great and lively to no fault of their own we were unable to experience the whole reason we booked with storm pack hitting the island we were wrapped indoors shame but staff and everything to do with room were great
staff is robotic not very friendly or helpful made le feel like a room number rowdy clients
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
the location and the staff especially to said he made are stay amazing because of him i’ll be coming back next year  thank you
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
i booked from booking and i paid with my credit card and when i went for choking in the woman in the reception said ok sir you confirmed your booking and you already paid but we need you credit card to take photo i show her my credit card with my name and my passport and i tell her for what you need a copy of my card she said dont worry sir it will be secret nobody will use it but i said no its my card and in already paid from booking and i will not give you a photo of my card with my account numbersfor the first time in my life a hotel ask about this
staff are everywhere and very attentive this place is a party of you don’t like to party book somewhere else
it was clean and in the center of all the action the staff were very nice and helpful
location  music  staff
best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
been here like  times over the years internet is now open to everyone no password internet was slow and went down often for a couple hours reception staff not friendly or helpful

the staff was very helpful and friendly you can book a sooner at the hotel very easy the view from the hotel is nice the position is very good
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
the staff at the hotel is more than great everybody is so friendly kind and helpful
we had the dulled room excellent room had everything you need looked great and the hotel was right on the beach the beach here was nice and quiet for being in middle of chewing staff went out of their way to help you at all times
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
very nice boutique hotel very friendly staff very good food the beach is nice but quiet
our stay was  days  we spent great time at royal beach resort the staff was very helpful  kind and all our requests were satisfied with smile the suit was very well equipped  clean the breakfast  a la cart menu were great  well done the swimming pool was clean  with warm water
the location was perfect within walking distances to everything and staff at reception where really friendly and pan at reservation was very helpful and great
poolside area is comfortable  ample poolbeds the towels feel great the shower work well the poolside staff are attentive helpful
lots of water sports equipment available  sums and kayaks and life vests are provided you can also sail on a small catamaran the staff always help with anything related to water sports
everything oozes quality  the towels the staff the rooms the robes the food and all the equipment
all staff are masters of their art attention to detail personalized experience
the staff were exceptional especially qui on the front desk who was super helpful daytime we had questions for her or needed something booked she would make phone calls and arrange everything we needed which made it easy for us nonthai speaking hussies the room was lovely and the pool and sunbeam right on the beach are great
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
great hotel amazing room with hot tub on the balcony staff were really friendly that breakfast excellent towels and water replaced each day highly recommended
excellent view and access to the beach well maintained grounds staff were helpful as well as friendly strong wifi which was very useful as i was working too  the hotel itself is a bit hidden located at the end of the road but accessible to nearby shops cases and restaurant
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
nice pool friendly staff and a nice breakfast
the staff was unbelievable kind super nice very friendly to children and extremely helpfulfrom the witness on the beach bar to the security guy and receptions they all seem to go way and above to make sure you have a great stay
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
the staff were just far so lovely and friendly the location is very central the beach is just beautiful and we stayed in a garden villa which was divine
i don’t think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i’ve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful
quiet location with no hawkers bothering you you can hand feed the tropical fish in the sea nice big bungalow very clean room staff were friendly and sir management were very helpful excellent value for what we paid
staff  wonderful views  comfortable rooms  peaceful
great staff  peaceful and relaxing accommodations  superior location  we felt very well cared for from the moment we arrived until our departure  highly recommend
basic but in a great location literally on the beach nighttime and bars are in walking distance but far away enough that the ones around you are a bit cheaper the two women who work on reception are sooooo funny and kind made my stay a million times better thank you
pool excellent staff are fabulous
staff are lovely and efficient
we took the  bedroom pool suite  it was great the staff was amazingly kind and helpingthe beach nearby is fantastic we have enjoyed every minute of our stay we will be more then happy to come back again
staff  service
staff were amazing very efficient friendly and amazing with the kiss
the room was more than we expected bathroom is large no need to worry about the toilet to get drenched staff were helpful and kind when we asked some information by email before we stay
we upgrade to a bungalow on the beach with our own pool the room was really comfortable and the view of the beach was fabulous  the restaurant was good the staff were great and it was great value for money  i would definitely return
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don’t want to travel as backpackers but don’t want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the pool the restaurant the friendly staff  ooh our friendly pool bar guy was so great and really good with our kiss too our friends stayed nearby at a more expensive hotel and were disappointed when they saw we got a better deal with better facilities
really good position close to the beach and restaurant shops daily cleaning and fresh water room was clean and come staff was kind luggage deposit available
great beach and very nice contest taxi and filipino staff is amazing very taking care of us and well supporting every request the rooms are very nice and clean
i spent four nights at relate as a solo traveler and it was absolutely fantastic the standout for me was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff the room pool and resort were absolutely immaculate the breakfast was delicious and gave plenty of energy for a wide range of activities that the resort can organise for you there are three shutters a day to chewing which makes this resort really easy to access the busier side of the island but is remote enough for you to really relax and get away from it all
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
excellent beautiful resort will definitely return breakfast and international restaurant on the beach were magnificent staff were friendly and very helpful rooms comfortable and clean also had a great sea experience
this should be a  star hotel the staff were so friendly the breakfast was really good the rooms were clean location is perfect  would recommend
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
relaxing end of the beach refreshing morning and evening swims right at our feet lovely staff
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
staff are nice and the room are good for this pricebreakfast buffets are good i would be there again just for the breakfastswimming pools are awesome and the rocky seashore are very beautiful all rooms are facing east so it’s a good place to see the sunriseshuttle bus to lamp beach chewing beach and other places goodwelcome beverages are good wonder what it is
fantastic location great staff beautiful views
beyond good service and staff clean and beautiful view of sea love this hotel
the pool bar staff were lovely as were the front reception and restaurant staff  loved the close proximity to fisherman’s village
the room was perfect the staff was really nice and helpfulshower room after you checked out if your flight is at the end of the day the pool is nice close to the beach
the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff were so friendly and happy to help a short walk from the centre of chewing  mind max it was far enough away to avoid all the noise but close enough to easily get to
the staff were very friendly and welcoming and the receptions spoke english and was very helpful booking the ferry and taxi when i was leaving the room was exactly like the pictures on the webster and everything was very clean and tidy
very friendly and helpful personal namely stepan see bird and others all the staff is very friendly

very friendly staff amazing hotel inch pool  panoramaview
staff  were good and ladies were kind but   for cleaning was irrational
staff and beach side views were great
nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the hotel is just amazing we had a room with a private pool and it was like heaven the staff is amazing the cocktail are good and the restaurant are fantastic shame its so far from home as i could see myself going back every year
staff were very nice and accommodation
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
generally a very nice resort good value really nice and helpful staff
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
great facilities on the door step to the beach  having a private pool was great  easy to get the team to set us up at the beach  which was a very short walk  good air conditioning and friendly team  short walk to  up the street  nice stroll down the beach to some great restraints and the night market on thursdays  personal mobile to call reception
the rooms staff and the location
good location really friendly staff nice big clean room
everything great staff great atmosphere and fantastic facilities the staff bent over backwards to help
very well maintained helpful staff and a relaxing pool
staff were absolutely fantastic particularly restaurant polar staff  gorgeous room and bed so come  great resort
great little studio room opposite the pool great pool lovely staff on site bike hire close enough to walk to the main chewing street mind which also makes it very peaceful in the resort they gave us a pleasant upgrade so we extended our stay highly recommend
rooms staff locations  access to main road and beach
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
very happy and polite staff no problems during our stay
green hilly territory not typical for same hotels nice sandy beach but was windy during our stay in early february excellent restaurant canal large nice rooms great grm helpful and friendly staff
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
staff all friendly just loved it
resort was beautiful and buffets breakfast had quite a good selection to choose from rooms were very spacious and staff made you feel like you were a valued guest the hotel offered a complementary scuttle service into chewing and the fisherman village at certain times which was a big plus we also hired a sooner through the hotel which was done at a fairly reasonable rate of  bath per day
the beach is very nice and secluded but sea was very rough in december so not much swimming possible most of the female staff are very polite and friendly and obliging sea is great  dont pick the fancy packages they are not value for money the room is very comfortable and large but again you need to get used to up and down within the room as well
staff was very nice and the beach was amazing looked like paradise breakfast was excellent
the food  staff facility was the best we stayed in the pool villa and we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
the staff were so helpful as i got there a day earlier than i should do they booked me straight into the room  and after a rain storm  can thank the staff enough excellent well done
staff and the owners are very friendlyfood is very deliciousfree pool tableunbelievable sweet cats and dogsnetflix in some roomsadvice its in the middle of nowhere we just stayed one night so it was fine for us if you anna have a silent and remote accommodation that the one for you
beach the staff big room
the staff is very kind  one of them is perry that was just wonderful
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
the property is in a great position nice pools  friendly staff
location honest staff  very helpful
staff are lovely friendly and helpful  service was great
very polite staff
the pool access villa was nice room  very clean the lap pool was lovely to swim staff in restaurant were very  friendly it was always nice to see noun  rook from the restaurant as they were always happy  welcoming
friendly staff
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
odor di uffa in reception
big rooms friendly staff
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn’t be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the staff on receptionrestaurant hardly speaks english and its a shame they dont understand simple questions like can you give me a weapon please or may i choose among bungalows or mine is the only one
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
the reception and restaurant staff were almost completely opposite
restaurant staff would stand there and stare at you while you topped up your plates during breakfast or while you were eating it
the reception on check in had an pleasant attitude
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
a little bit noisy for couples as a lot of families and kiss were visiting there is only  treadmill at the grm sometimes kiss would come and play with grm facilities and i wish there was hotel staff supervising
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
very small room and the doors wont lock staff only available until pm
its a good  min walk from the centre of lamp the pool and sea are actually in another building on the opposite side of a very busy road although i hey do have a security guard there to help you cross
bungalow was at the back of the resort long and confusing route to and from reception and restaurant
the staff was sometimes not friendly almost rude
the air condition broke and the water start leaking trough the light so we must packed and changed the room in the middle of the night no apology was given from the staff
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help the breakfast buffets was white overpriced for what was on offer
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional £ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don’t release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they’re all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn’t have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn’t need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn’t go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that’s all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
to reach the restaurant and than to come back you have to climb so many steps to go to the room or the reception
staff helpful
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
pressure of shower was very bad it was challenging to wash long hair hotel staff seemed to be tired and bored almost no smiles seemed they didn want to do their job night shift didn speak english no option even get morning coffee before am even if  breakfast was paid we went to boattrip at  and they only said that well have breakfast included there slice of cook banana and coffee is not breakfast disappointing  we had paid for breakfast no refund
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
lack of service in the restaurant—the staff stayed in a corner to themselves chatting and ignored the customers
not hotels fault but the beach is not good for babies as it is not shallow and the sea was pretty wavy also even tough wifi reception was good the connection is very slow
this was marked as a water park but it had closed and our  year old daughter was very upset the maid was very rude and told us our feet sunk i would like my money back
struggled with english with some members of staff but when more client people was around had no issues
the staff is sometimes not very responsive to phone calls from the room or they may forget to do something such as bringing additional bottles of water
the hotel itself was dated and in need of refurbishments the water pressure in the shower was inconsistent it often cut out and the temperature was on the cooper side whilst they tried their best it was difficult at times to communicate with staff
needs to provide a scuttle service to lamp bathroom need a reap and a proper clean was given different price quotes for the same thing by different staff members which makes one suspicious
there are areas within the complex which need renovation balconies were very worn some rotten which is worrying especially if you have children the plunge pools should be on times instead of having to call reception to turn them on and off each day the pools need cleaning our pool had a black sum around the water line gutters need emptying when it rains water falls everywhere except where its meant to go
the entrance and reception look quite bad the first impression is really important i felt like i’m in a  stars resort until i saw the roomsome new equipment for the grm will be awesome
there were many rocks in the beach just outside the resort making swimming more difficult we upgrade from our original booking the room booked was called superior double with garden view it was very old small and disappointing as not like the photo on bookingcomor taken many years ago unfortunately  some of the staff spoke and understood only a little english making communication more difficultgreat beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it’s noisy but only till  am
first of all its not really a party until pm  dont expect the pm pool party to be crazy its mostly families the staff are super strict on the rules  you only get one towel with your key cards per day which they dont tell you also the power annoying shuts off whenever you take the key out of the room which is good for the hotel to save power but really annoying when its  degrees f and your room is boiling hot because the ac shuts off every single time you leave
very well trained staff and excellent service  precise and professional
the staff
good location helpful staff
from beginning to end the ark bar was excellent the staff were friendly the rooms were clean food was excellent entertainment and tunes were banging and i wouldn’t hesitate to go there again tomorrow or recommend to all my friends and family
the hotel is lovely location beautiful facilities and nice live gathers and friendly staff
close to main area in chewing staff is polite
no hot water in the shower the staff wasn’t nice and attentive they didn’t listen to the problem and didn’t fix it we showered in cold water throughout the stay
the position of the hotel and it offers a great night out with fantastic staff
ideal location excellent staff and very clean
very well managed polite helpful staff the bed was comfortable the room was well designed and the bathroom was great tree bar pool was excellent and just steps to the beach the breakfast included was good quality and ample choice food in the restaurant was good
the team from the location
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the hotel is really nice location and also very friendly staff with all the facilities under one roof also the hotel allowed us an early check in co of availability and the request for late check out was offered with a normal fee till  in evening as we had a late flight
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
good location right on beach front close to most stuff  airport  piers for if you’re moving to other oh islands rooms were spacious also staff were good lively at night with a lot going on fire shows dancers etc
harry and his team at reception did a fantastic job super friendly and will to assist wherever possible the hotel is rewarded with great staff housekeeping did a great job along with the bar and restaurant staff great place for the young at heart party all day from  am
behaviour of the reception staff
reception staff  not so helpful and courteous
hotel was great and lively to no fault of their own we were unable to experience the whole reason we booked with storm pack hitting the island we were wrapped indoors shame but staff and everything to do with room were great
staff is robotic not very friendly or helpful made le feel like a room number rowdy clients
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
the location and the staff especially to said he made are stay amazing because of him i’ll be coming back next year  thank you
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
i booked from booking and i paid with my credit card and when i went for choking in the woman in the reception said ok sir you confirmed your booking and you already paid but we need you credit card to take photo i show her my credit card with my name and my passport and i tell her for what you need a copy of my card she said dont worry sir it will be secret nobody will use it but i said no its my card and in already paid from booking and i will not give you a photo of my card with my account numbersfor the first time in my life a hotel ask about this
staff are everywhere and very attentive this place is a party of you don’t like to party book somewhere else
it was clean and in the center of all the action the staff were very nice and helpful
location  music  staff
best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
been here like  times over the years internet is now open to everyone no password internet was slow and went down often for a couple hours reception staff not friendly or helpful

overall is very good swimming pool is amazing walking distance to shops and the beach staff were really nice
the staff was very helpful and friendly you can book a sooner at the hotel very easy the view from the hotel is nice the position is very good
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
the staff at the hotel is more than great everybody is so friendly kind and helpful
we had the dulled room excellent room had everything you need looked great and the hotel was right on the beach the beach here was nice and quiet for being in middle of chewing staff went out of their way to help you at all times
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it
very nice boutique hotel very friendly staff very good food the beach is nice but quiet
our stay was  days  we spent great time at royal beach resort the staff was very helpful  kind and all our requests were satisfied with smile the suit was very well equipped  clean the breakfast  a la cart menu were great  well done the swimming pool was clean  with warm water

everything oozes quality  the towels the staff the rooms the robes the food and all the equipment
all staff are masters of their art attention to detail personalized experience
the staff were exceptional especially qui on the front desk who was super helpful daytime we had questions for her or needed something booked she would make phone calls and arrange everything we needed which made it easy for us nonthai speaking hussies the room was lovely and the pool and sunbeam right on the beach are great
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
great hotel amazing room with hot tub on the balcony staff were really friendly that breakfast excellent towels and water replaced each day highly recommended
excellent view and access to the beach well maintained grounds staff were helpful as well as friendly strong wifi which was very useful as i was working too  the hotel itself is a bit hidden located at the end of the road but accessible to nearby shops cases and restaurant
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
nice pool friendly staff and a nice breakfast
the staff was unbelievable kind super nice very friendly to children and extremely helpfulfrom the witness on the beach bar to the security guy and receptions they all seem to go way and above to make sure you have a great stay
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
the staff were just far so lovely and friendly the location is very central the beach is just beautiful and we stayed in a garden villa which was divine
i don’t think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i’ve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful
quiet location with no hawkers bothering you you can hand feed the tropical fish in the sea nice big bungalow very clean room staff were friendly and sir management were very helpful excellent value for what we paid
staff  wonderful views  comfortable rooms  peaceful
great staff  peaceful and relaxing accommodations  superior location  we felt very well cared for from the moment we arrived until our departure  highly recommend
basic but in a great location literally on the beach nighttime and bars are in walking distance but far away enough that the ones around you are a bit cheaper the two women who work on reception are sooooo funny and kind made my stay a million times better thank you
pool excellent staff are fabulous
staff are lovely and efficient
we took the  bedroom pool suite  it was great the staff was amazingly kind and helpingthe beach nearby is fantastic we have enjoyed every minute of our stay we will be more then happy to come back again
staff  service
staff were amazing very efficient friendly and amazing with the kiss
the room was more than we expected bathroom is large no need to worry about the toilet to get drenched staff were helpful and kind when we asked some information by email before we stay
we upgrade to a bungalow on the beach with our own pool the room was really comfortable and the view of the beach was fabulous  the restaurant was good the staff were great and it was great value for money  i would definitely return
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don’t want to travel as backpackers but don’t want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the pool the restaurant the friendly staff  ooh our friendly pool bar guy was so great and really good with our kiss too our friends stayed nearby at a more expensive hotel and were disappointed when they saw we got a better deal with better facilities
really good position close to the beach and restaurant shops daily cleaning and fresh water room was clean and come staff was kind luggage deposit available
great beach and very nice contest taxi and filipino staff is amazing very taking care of us and well supporting every request the rooms are very nice and clean
i spent four nights at relate as a solo traveler and it was absolutely fantastic the standout for me was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff the room pool and resort were absolutely immaculate the breakfast was delicious and gave plenty of energy for a wide range of activities that the resort can organise for you there are three shutters a day to chewing which makes this resort really easy to access the busier side of the island but is remote enough for you to really relax and get away from it all
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
excellent beautiful resort will definitely return breakfast and international restaurant on the beach were magnificent staff were friendly and very helpful rooms comfortable and clean also had a great sea experience
this should be a  star hotel the staff were so friendly the breakfast was really good the rooms were clean location is perfect  would recommend
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
relaxing end of the beach refreshing morning and evening swims right at our feet lovely staff
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
staff are nice and the room are good for this pricebreakfast buffets are good i would be there again just for the breakfastswimming pools are awesome and the rocky seashore are very beautiful all rooms are facing east so it’s a good place to see the sunriseshuttle bus to lamp beach chewing beach and other places goodwelcome beverages are good wonder what it is
fantastic location great staff beautiful views
beyond good service and staff clean and beautiful view of sea love this hotel
the pool bar staff were lovely as were the front reception and restaurant staff  loved the close proximity to fisherman’s village
the room was perfect the staff was really nice and helpfulshower room after you checked out if your flight is at the end of the day the pool is nice close to the beach
the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff were so friendly and happy to help a short walk from the centre of chewing  mind max it was far enough away to avoid all the noise but close enough to easily get to
the staff were very friendly and welcoming and the receptions spoke english and was very helpful booking the ferry and taxi when i was leaving the room was exactly like the pictures on the webster and everything was very clean and tidy
very friendly and helpful personal namely stepan see bird and others all the staff is very friendly

very friendly staff amazing hotel inch pool  panoramaview
staff  were good and ladies were kind but   for cleaning was irrational
staff and beach side views were great
nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the hotel is just amazing we had a room with a private pool and it was like heaven the staff is amazing the cocktail are good and the restaurant are fantastic shame its so far from home as i could see myself going back every year
staff were very nice and accommodation
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
generally a very nice resort good value really nice and helpful staff
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
great facilities on the door step to the beach  having a private pool was great  easy to get the team to set us up at the beach  which was a very short walk  good air conditioning and friendly team  short walk to  up the street  nice stroll down the beach to some great restraints and the night market on thursdays  personal mobile to call reception
the rooms staff and the location
good location really friendly staff nice big clean room
everything great staff great atmosphere and fantastic facilities the staff bent over backwards to help
very well maintained helpful staff and a relaxing pool
staff were absolutely fantastic particularly restaurant polar staff  gorgeous room and bed so come  great resort
great little studio room opposite the pool great pool lovely staff on site bike hire close enough to walk to the main chewing street mind which also makes it very peaceful in the resort they gave us a pleasant upgrade so we extended our stay highly recommend
rooms staff locations  access to main road and beach
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
very happy and polite staff no problems during our stay
green hilly territory not typical for same hotels nice sandy beach but was windy during our stay in early february excellent restaurant canal large nice rooms great grm helpful and friendly staff
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
staff all friendly just loved it
resort was beautiful and buffets breakfast had quite a good selection to choose from rooms were very spacious and staff made you feel like you were a valued guest the hotel offered a complementary scuttle service into chewing and the fisherman village at certain times which was a big plus we also hired a sooner through the hotel which was done at a fairly reasonable rate of  bath per day
the beach is very nice and secluded but sea was very rough in december so not much swimming possible most of the female staff are very polite and friendly and obliging sea is great  dont pick the fancy packages they are not value for money the room is very comfortable and large but again you need to get used to up and down within the room as well
staff was very nice and the beach was amazing looked like paradise breakfast was excellent
the food  staff facility was the best we stayed in the pool villa and we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
the staff were so helpful as i got there a day earlier than i should do they booked me straight into the room  and after a rain storm  can thank the staff enough excellent well done
staff and the owners are very friendlyfood is very deliciousfree pool tableunbelievable sweet cats and dogsnetflix in some roomsadvice its in the middle of nowhere we just stayed one night so it was fine for us if you anna have a silent and remote accommodation that the one for you
beach the staff big room
the staff is very kind  one of them is perry that was just wonderful
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
the property is in a great position nice pools  friendly staff
location honest staff  very helpful
staff are lovely friendly and helpful  service was great
very polite staff
the pool access villa was nice room  very clean the lap pool was lovely to swim staff in restaurant were very  friendly it was always nice to see noun  rook from the restaurant as they were always happy  welcoming
friendly staff
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
odor di uffa in reception
big rooms friendly staff
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn’t be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the staff on receptionrestaurant hardly speaks english and its a shame they dont understand simple questions like can you give me a weapon please or may i choose among bungalows or mine is the only one
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
the reception and restaurant staff were almost completely opposite
restaurant staff would stand there and stare at you while you topped up your plates during breakfast or while you were eating it
the reception on check in had an pleasant attitude
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
a little bit noisy for couples as a lot of families and kiss were visiting there is only  treadmill at the grm sometimes kiss would come and play with grm facilities and i wish there was hotel staff supervising
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
very small room and the doors wont lock staff only available until pm
its a good  min walk from the centre of lamp the pool and sea are actually in another building on the opposite side of a very busy road although i hey do have a security guard there to help you cross
bungalow was at the back of the resort long and confusing route to and from reception and restaurant
the staff was sometimes not friendly almost rude
the air condition broke and the water start leaking trough the light so we must packed and changed the room in the middle of the night no apology was given from the staff
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help the breakfast buffets was white overpriced for what was on offer
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional £ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don’t release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they’re all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn’t have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn’t need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn’t go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that’s all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
to reach the restaurant and than to come back you have to climb so many steps to go to the room or the reception
staff helpful
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
pressure of shower was very bad it was challenging to wash long hair hotel staff seemed to be tired and bored almost no smiles seemed they didn want to do their job night shift didn speak english no option even get morning coffee before am even if  breakfast was paid we went to boattrip at  and they only said that well have breakfast included there slice of cook banana and coffee is not breakfast disappointing  we had paid for breakfast no refund
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
lack of service in the restaurant—the staff stayed in a corner to themselves chatting and ignored the customers
not hotels fault but the beach is not good for babies as it is not shallow and the sea was pretty wavy also even tough wifi reception was good the connection is very slow
this was marked as a water park but it had closed and our  year old daughter was very upset the maid was very rude and told us our feet sunk i would like my money back
struggled with english with some members of staff but when more client people was around had no issues
the staff is sometimes not very responsive to phone calls from the room or they may forget to do something such as bringing additional bottles of water
the hotel itself was dated and in need of refurbishments the water pressure in the shower was inconsistent it often cut out and the temperature was on the cooper side whilst they tried their best it was difficult at times to communicate with staff
needs to provide a scuttle service to lamp bathroom need a reap and a proper clean was given different price quotes for the same thing by different staff members which makes one suspicious
there are areas within the complex which need renovation balconies were very worn some rotten which is worrying especially if you have children the plunge pools should be on times instead of having to call reception to turn them on and off each day the pools need cleaning our pool had a black sum around the water line gutters need emptying when it rains water falls everywhere except where its meant to go
the entrance and reception look quite bad the first impression is really important i felt like i’m in a  stars resort until i saw the roomsome new equipment for the grm will be awesome
there were many rocks in the beach just outside the resort making swimming more difficult we upgrade from our original booking the room booked was called superior double with garden view it was very old small and disappointing as not like the photo on bookingcomor taken many years ago unfortunately  some of the staff spoke and understood only a little english making communication more difficultgreat beach resort staff was amazing and very helpful if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to be the beach parties were very enjoyable and the restaurant was good as well the rooms were clean and the bed was come i would definitely recommend and return
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it’s noisy but only till  am
first of all its not really a party until pm  dont expect the pm pool party to be crazy its mostly families the staff are super strict on the rules  you only get one towel with your key cards per day which they dont tell you also the power annoying shuts off whenever you take the key out of the room which is good for the hotel to save power but really annoying when its  degrees f and your room is boiling hot because the ac shuts off every single time you leave
very well trained staff and excellent service  precise and professional
the staff
good location helpful staff
from beginning to end the ark bar was excellent the staff were friendly the rooms were clean food was excellent entertainment and tunes were banging and i wouldn’t hesitate to go there again tomorrow or recommend to all my friends and family
the hotel is lovely location beautiful facilities and nice live gathers and friendly staff
close to main area in chewing staff is polite
no hot water in the shower the staff wasn’t nice and attentive they didn’t listen to the problem and didn’t fix it we showered in cold water throughout the stay
the position of the hotel and it offers a great night out with fantastic staff
ideal location excellent staff and very clean
very well managed polite helpful staff the bed was comfortable the room was well designed and the bathroom was great tree bar pool was excellent and just steps to the beach the breakfast included was good quality and ample choice food in the restaurant was good
the team from the location
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the hotel is really nice location and also very friendly staff with all the facilities under one roof also the hotel allowed us an early check in co of availability and the request for late check out was offered with a normal fee till  in evening as we had a late flight
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous
good location right on beach front close to most stuff  airport  piers for if you’re moving to other oh islands rooms were spacious also staff were good lively at night with a lot going on fire shows dancers etc
harry and his team at reception did a fantastic job super friendly and will to assist wherever possible the hotel is rewarded with great staff housekeeping did a great job along with the bar and restaurant staff great place for the young at heart party all day from  am
behaviour of the reception staff
reception staff  not so helpful and courteous
hotel was great and lively to no fault of their own we were unable to experience the whole reason we booked with storm pack hitting the island we were wrapped indoors shame but staff and everything to do with room were great
staff is robotic not very friendly or helpful made le feel like a room number rowdy clients
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
the location and the staff especially to said he made are stay amazing because of him i’ll be coming back next year  thank you
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
i booked from booking and i paid with my credit card and when i went for choking in the woman in the reception said ok sir you confirmed your booking and you already paid but we need you credit card to take photo i show her my credit card with my name and my passport and i tell her for what you need a copy of my card she said dont worry sir it will be secret nobody will use it but i said no its my card and in already paid from booking and i will not give you a photo of my card with my account numbersfor the first time in my life a hotel ask about this
staff are everywhere and very attentive this place is a party of you don’t like to party book somewhere else
it was clean and in the center of all the action the staff were very nice and helpful
location  music  staff
best place to stay in oh same we were traveling as a family ages ranging from    perfect location right on the beach comfortable bed the staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful best location for fire dancers and the pool parties were great it reminded me of ocean beach in tibia but without the price tag very reasonably prices surrounding areas include some of the best shops state of the art grand plenty of food and drink option on your door step
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
best parting in oh same great pool and beach staff is excellent but food is ok perfect place is you want to have fun would not recommend for families though  travelled with two friends and we stayed in the deluge double which where great
been here like  times over the years internet is now open to everyone no password internet was slow and went down often for a couple hours reception staff not friendly or helpful

overall is very good swimming pool is amazing walking distance to shops and the beach staff were really nice
the staff was very helpful and friendly you can book a sooner at the hotel very easy the view from the hotel is nice the position is very good
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
the staff at the hotel is more than great everybody is so friendly kind and helpful
we had the dulled room excellent room had everything you need looked great and the hotel was right on the beach the beach here was nice and quiet for being in middle of chewing staff went out of their way to help you at all times
the most amazing location and view the hotel was clean and had amazing interior the staff were incredible people who were friendly  daring any time of day would recommend anyone to stay in this hotel as the food pools room and the stunning view is worth it

everything oozes quality  the towels the staff the rooms the robes the food and all the equipment
all staff are masters of their art attention to detail personalized experience
the staff were exceptional especially qui on the front desk who was super helpful daytime we had questions for her or needed something booked she would make phone calls and arrange everything we needed which made it easy for us nonthai speaking hussies the room was lovely and the pool and sunbeam right on the beach are great
what a wonderful place hidden next to a busy street and close to the airport amazing that we did not hear planes or street maybe because we had a bungalow close to the sea wonderful resort wonderful live music on sunday evenings excellent food very good quality the dutch leadership team and their members from thailand make an excellent job fully recommended
great hotel amazing room with hot tub on the balcony staff were really friendly that breakfast excellent towels and water replaced each day highly recommended
excellent view and access to the beach well maintained grounds staff were helpful as well as friendly strong wifi which was very useful as i was working too  the hotel itself is a bit hidden located at the end of the road but accessible to nearby shops cases and restaurant
excellent location we loved having the beach just across the road great massage place right next door bath  he that massage had a mountain view room and it was very quiet at night ask for even room numbers for mountain facing rooms rd floor gives mountain views nd floor facing the mountain just shows you the roof of the next building very come bed but other than that everything else was clean besides the floor friendly staff close to a bunch of restaurant though food on the to same is more expensive than pocket and bangkok
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
nice pool friendly staff and a nice breakfast
the staff was unbelievable kind super nice very friendly to children and extremely helpfulfrom the witness on the beach bar to the security guy and receptions they all seem to go way and above to make sure you have a great stay
spacious living area clean beach with a lot of privacy food was delicious staff were amazing  super friendly and accommodation i haven been served by such hospitable and friendly people before
the staff were just far so lovely and friendly the location is very central the beach is just beautiful and we stayed in a garden villa which was divine
i don’t think is a  stars hotel it deserves  stars never saw a similar place in from of the sea close to the city the staff was the best they are so kind and friendly and always ready to help you for anything the room was not a normal room but a villa huge villa and common spaces are so clean the view from the resort is pretty amazing i think in future i will come back to dark same and tell to all my family and friends to come there if they want to relax my real compliments goes to the staff you are the best i’ve loved my experience in same with my staying at dark same thank you
we booked the beach villa which was superb it had a little private part of the beach for our use with its own sunbeam and a staircase down to the water close to the restaurant and bar which was an added plus all in all we spent a very relaxed few days away from the crowds and noise the staff were super attendant and very helpful
quiet location with no hawkers bothering you you can hand feed the tropical fish in the sea nice big bungalow very clean room staff were friendly and sir management were very helpful excellent value for what we paid
staff  wonderful views  comfortable rooms  peaceful
great staff  peaceful and relaxing accommodations  superior location  we felt very well cared for from the moment we arrived until our departure  highly recommend
basic but in a great location literally on the beach nighttime and bars are in walking distance but far away enough that the ones around you are a bit cheaper the two women who work on reception are sooooo funny and kind made my stay a million times better thank you
pool excellent staff are fabulous
staff are lovely and efficient
we took the  bedroom pool suite  it was great the staff was amazingly kind and helpingthe beach nearby is fantastic we have enjoyed every minute of our stay we will be more then happy to come back again
staff  service

the room was more than we expected bathroom is large no need to worry about the toilet to get drenched staff were helpful and kind when we asked some information by email before we stay
we upgrade to a bungalow on the beach with our own pool the room was really comfortable and the view of the beach was fabulous  the restaurant was good the staff were great and it was great value for money  i would definitely return
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don’t want to travel as backpackers but don’t want a  stars this is the ideal solution
great location if you like to be away from the crowds  friendly staff
the pool the restaurant the friendly staff  ooh our friendly pool bar guy was so great and really good with our kiss too our friends stayed nearby at a more expensive hotel and were disappointed when they saw we got a better deal with better facilities
really good position close to the beach and restaurant shops daily cleaning and fresh water room was clean and come staff was kind luggage deposit available
great beach and very nice contest taxi and filipino staff is amazing very taking care of us and well supporting every request the rooms are very nice and clean
i spent four nights at relate as a solo traveler and it was absolutely fantastic the standout for me was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff the room pool and resort were absolutely immaculate the breakfast was delicious and gave plenty of energy for a wide range of activities that the resort can organise for you there are three shutters a day to chewing which makes this resort really easy to access the busier side of the island but is remote enough for you to really relax and get away from it all
loved every minute the hotel was as expected beautiful beach the staff couldn do enough for you excellent location nice and quiet on a night but not far from bars and restaurant
excellent beautiful resort will definitely return breakfast and international restaurant on the beach were magnificent staff were friendly and very helpful rooms comfortable and clean also had a great sea experience
this should be a  star hotel the staff were so friendly the breakfast was really good the rooms were clean location is perfect  would recommend
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
relaxing end of the beach refreshing morning and evening swims right at our feet lovely staff
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
staff are nice and the room are good for this pricebreakfast buffets are good i would be there again just for the breakfastswimming pools are awesome and the rocky seashore are very beautiful all rooms are facing east so it’s a good place to see the sunriseshuttle bus to lamp beach chewing beach and other places goodwelcome beverages are good wonder what it is
fantastic location great staff beautiful views
beyond good service and staff clean and beautiful view of sea love this hotel
the pool bar staff were lovely as were the front reception and restaurant staff  loved the close proximity to fisherman’s village
the room was perfect the staff was really nice and helpfulshower room after you checked out if your flight is at the end of the day the pool is nice close to the beach
the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff were so friendly and happy to help a short walk from the centre of chewing  mind max it was far enough away to avoid all the noise but close enough to easily get to
the staff were very friendly and welcoming and the receptions spoke english and was very helpful booking the ferry and taxi when i was leaving the room was exactly like the pictures on the webster and everything was very clean and tidy
very friendly and helpful personal namely stepan see bird and others all the staff is very friendly

very friendly staff amazing hotel inch pool  panoramaview
staff  were good and ladies were kind but   for cleaning was irrational
staff and beach side views were great
nice place to stay very near to chewing beach center in a great price the room is really nice and has a nice balcony but there is a noise from outside cause the location is on the main road cleanliness at a good level and staff was nice
the hotel is just amazing we had a room with a private pool and it was like heaven the staff is amazing the cocktail are good and the restaurant are fantastic shame its so far from home as i could see myself going back every year
staff were very nice and accommodation
spacious rooms come professional and kind staff all rooms overlook the sea and few peters far from the shore the view fro my room was amazing the resort is located at quite area walk distance from the market and loads of option for dining
the resort was very clean and in a quiet location the staff were friendly and the front desk very helpful
generally a very nice resort good value really nice and helpful staff
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
great facilities on the door step to the beach  having a private pool was great  easy to get the team to set us up at the beach  which was a very short walk  good air conditioning and friendly team  short walk to  up the street  nice stroll down the beach to some great restraints and the night market on thursdays  personal mobile to call reception
the rooms staff and the location
good location really friendly staff nice big clean room
everything great staff great atmosphere and fantastic facilities the staff bent over backwards to help
very well maintained helpful staff and a relaxing pool
staff were absolutely fantastic particularly restaurant polar staff  gorgeous room and bed so come  great resort
great little studio room opposite the pool great pool lovely staff on site bike hire close enough to walk to the main chewing street mind which also makes it very peaceful in the resort they gave us a pleasant upgrade so we extended our stay highly recommend
rooms staff locations  access to main road and beach
everything was fantastic staff food hotel and location child friendly and the staff was terrific they met all our needs and we will definitely be staying there again
a beautiful setting away from the rustle and bustle of the towns and reaches the staff especially to were engaging we had a  bedroom suite in the hotel the size of a small house we loved the addition of a two person sea bath that was in its own room which served as a peaceful gateway for the parents the hotel pool was never crowded and such a beautiful backdrop with tropical lush rainforest we really didn want to leave
very happy and polite staff no problems during our stay
green hilly territory not typical for same hotels nice sandy beach but was windy during our stay in early february excellent restaurant canal large nice rooms great grm helpful and friendly staff
staff really helpful location right in the middle of everything and amazing decoration
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach to yourself what stood out the most was the attention to detail from the colonies in the evening left in our room to the scoop of ice cream that they give you in the afternoon the staff is excellent  were there with a smile to help in any way they could breakfast was exceptional and the drinks  food were great we were on honeymoon  loved every minute we would definitely recommend the scent to anyone the place smells lovely our room sea view was very big the air conditioning worked well  it had a very good sized bathroom there was also a nice wrap around balcony and a swing chair
the water in the shower was hot the room was clean and iceland mostly he location was amazing right in the middle of the chewing less than  min to the beach or to the clubs the staff was very friendly and were easy to understand
staff were all friendly beds were quite comfortable location on the beach and next to walking street was great
staff all friendly just loved it
resort was beautiful and buffets breakfast had quite a good selection to choose from rooms were very spacious and staff made you feel like you were a valued guest the hotel offered a complementary scuttle service into chewing and the fisherman village at certain times which was a big plus we also hired a sooner through the hotel which was done at a fairly reasonable rate of  bath per day
the beach is very nice and secluded but sea was very rough in december so not much swimming possible most of the female staff are very polite and friendly and obliging sea is great  dont pick the fancy packages they are not value for money the room is very comfortable and large but again you need to get used to up and down within the room as well
staff was very nice and the beach was amazing looked like paradise breakfast was excellent
the food  staff facility was the best we stayed in the pool villa and we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
the staff were so helpful as i got there a day earlier than i should do they booked me straight into the room  and after a rain storm  can thank the staff enough excellent well done
staff and the owners are very friendlyfood is very deliciousfree pool tableunbelievable sweet cats and dogsnetflix in some roomsadvice its in the middle of nowhere we just stayed one night so it was fine for us if you anna have a silent and remote accommodation that the one for you
beach the staff big room
the staff is very kind  one of them is perry that was just wonderful
this hostel was amazing the staff are super friendly and helpful with everything the bar area and the pool are awesome to unkind for a few hours the rooms are really great with ac and comfortable beds its also less than  minutes from the beach and everything else in bout already planning on coming back and staying here
the property is in a great position nice pools  friendly staff
location honest staff  very helpful
staff are lovely friendly and helpful  service was great
very polite staff
the pool access villa was nice room  very clean the lap pool was lovely to swim staff in restaurant were very  friendly it was always nice to see noun  rook from the restaurant as they were always happy  welcoming
friendly staff
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
beautiful gardens everywhere sensational pool right on a gorgeous beach location was ideal staff were very helpful happy and efficient loved our stay
odor di uffa in reception
big rooms friendly staff
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpool wifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn’t be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour
the staff on receptionrestaurant hardly speaks english and its a shame they dont understand simple questions like can you give me a weapon please or may i choose among bungalows or mine is the only one
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place
the reception and restaurant staff were almost completely opposite
restaurant staff would stand there and stare at you while you topped up your plates during breakfast or while you were eating it
the reception on check in had an pleasant attitude
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
a little bit noisy for couples as a lot of families and kiss were visiting there is only  treadmill at the grm sometimes kiss would come and play with grm facilities and i wish there was hotel staff supervising
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude
very small room and the doors wont lock staff only available until pm
its a good  min walk from the centre of lamp the pool and sea are actually in another building on the opposite side of a very busy road although i hey do have a security guard there to help you cross
bungalow was at the back of the resort long and confusing route to and from reception and restaurant
the staff was sometimes not friendly almost rude
the air condition broke and the water start leaking trough the light so we must packed and changed the room in the middle of the night no apology was given from the staff
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help the breakfast buffets was white overpriced for what was on offer
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional £ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don’t release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they’re all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn’t have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn’t need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn’t go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that’s all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
to reach the restaurant and than to come back you have to climb so many steps to go to the room or the reception
staff helpful
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel
pressure of shower was very bad it was challenging to wash long hair hotel staff seemed to be tired and bored almost no smiles seemed they didn want to do their job night shift didn speak english no option even get morning coffee before am even if  breakfast was paid we went to boattrip at  and they only said that well have breakfast included there slice of cook banana and coffee is not breakfast disappointing  we had paid for breakfast no refund
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
lack of service in the restaurant—the staff stayed in a corner to themselves chatting and ignored the customers
not hotels fault but the beach is not good for babies as it is not shallow and the sea was pretty wavy also even tough wifi reception was good the connection is very slow
this was marked as a water park but it had closed and our  year old daughter was very upset the maid was very rude and told us our feet sunk i would like my money back
struggled with english with some members of staff but when more client people was around had no issues
the staff is sometimes not very responsive to phone calls from the room or they may forget to do something such as bringing additional bottles of water
the hotel itself was dated and in need of refurbishments the water pressure in the shower was inconsistent it often cut out and the temperature was on the cooper side whilst they tried their best it was difficult at times to communicate with staff
needs to provide a scuttle service to lamp bathroom need a reap and a proper clean was given different price quotes for the same thing by different staff members which makes one suspicious
there are areas within the complex which need renovation balconies were very worn some rotten which is worrying especially if you have children the plunge pools should be on times instead of having to call reception to turn them on and off each day the pools need cleaning our pool had a black sum around the water line gutters need emptying when it rains water falls everywhere except where its meant to go
the entrance and reception look quite bad the first impression is really important i felt like i’m in a  stars resort until i saw the roomsome new equipment for the grm will be awesome
there were many rocks in the beach just outside the resort making swimming more difficult we upgrade from our original booking the room booked was called superior double with garden view it was very old small and disappointing as not like the photo on bookingcomor taken many years ago unfortunately  some of the staff spoke and understood only a little english making communication more difficult

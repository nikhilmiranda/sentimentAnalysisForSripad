i definitely liked the location and accommodation in my opinion this hotel was a good value for the money 
great value for money we had a room that wasn’t too loud from the pool party when we had finished for the night the property has everything on site such as sundry services massage taxi  sooner higher pool party was the best definitely coming back
i was also charged money for a missing cup that was actually just in another room and it was removed by the cleaner before i could take it to my room the next day
overpriced no value for money the pool party is highly operated
wifi was terrible and only worked periodically room was very basic and was not like the pictures portray and not at all good value for money
i booked from booking and i paid with my credit card and when i went for choking in the woman in the reception said ok sir you confirmed your booking and you already paid but we need you credit card to take photo i show her my credit card with my name and my passport and i tell her for what you need a copy of my card she said dont worry sir it will be secret nobody will use it but i said no its my card and in already paid from booking and i will not give you a photo of my card with my account numbersfor the first time in my life a hotel ask about this
it was one of the prices places around that area but you really do get your money worth
room is big and very clean good location if you want to party if you want a quiet night in not a good idea to stay here loud music go on till am then the beach club finished you hear drunk people leaving staffs are friendly food is great party here great worth the money room very clean
the food is terrific amazing chef presentation as well as flavor was spot on  its a boutique hotel which means not to many other guests we had private dinners for no extra money because of the low season as well the swimming pool area was nicely decorated the whole hotel actually had an amazing flow and calming vice the staff was super helpful the bed was tip top we slept like babies good nights rest is something you dont notice until you dont have it liked the closet as well  big drawerslocation was at the end of the bay and side road of the big road connecting to same really handy for daytrips would advise this hotel to people seeking rest
we upgrade to a bungalow on the beach with our own pool the room was really comfortable and the view of the beach was fabulous  the restaurant was good the staff were great and it was great value for money  i would definitely return
in addition to general cleanliness good staff and good location this hotel offers an excellent breakfast value for money and one of the best pool bars we tried in the islands for people who don’t want to travel as backpackers but don’t want a  stars this is the ideal solution
really good position close to the beach and restaurant shops daily cleaning and fresh water room was clean and come staff was kind luggage deposit available
in terms of accommodation this resort was value for money  the room was clean and comfortable the food taste the beer cold and the waiter was extremely friendly and beat however he seemed to be the only one
amazing value for money lovely pool and beach front restaurant couldn have asked for better value for money
the scent is a boutique hotel with no more than  rooms which gives you an amazing value for money our room was amazing the detail to decoration was brought to the extreme making the place a real magazine room staff was lovely very attentive and they are always trying to make you feel as family the restaurant was incredible great food next to the beach the hotel is less than min by bike to fisherman village very nice place full of restaurant i would decently go back if i ever have the opportunity
the property was in a perfect location such good value for money and amazing views
the beach is very nice and secluded but sea was very rough in december so not much swimming possible most of the female staff are very polite and friendly and obliging sea is great  dont pick the fancy packages they are not value for money the room is very comfortable and large but again you need to get used to up and down within the room as well
great location and value for money the kiss loved the pool
a nice familyrun resort with beach and swimming pool offering very reasonable prices for same everything gives excellent value for money including the restaurant
sadly i was only here for one night but wish i’d had longer upon arrival i was met by really helpful staff and led to my beautiful room leading straight onto a small beach all the small attention to detail in the rooms was beautiful the breakfast was extremely good value for money
good value for the money
the mattress were not comftroble the bath without window a smell of mold in sleep soothe breakfast was poor and the amount was insufficient for all the guests
because we forgot the credit card we booked and paid with back in april there was an issue at check in they refused the original card and charged us on one of the cards we had with us so we lost out on the exchange rate and bank charges
not value for money
you can get better hotels for the same money
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional £ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don’t release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they’re all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn’t have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn’t need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn’t go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that’s all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it
pressure of shower was very bad it was challenging to wash long hair hotel staff seemed to be tired and bored almost no smiles seemed they didn want to do their job night shift didn speak english no option even get morning coffee before am even if  breakfast was paid we went to boattrip at  and they only said that well have breakfast included there slice of cook banana and coffee is not breakfast disappointing  we had paid for breakfast no refund
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end
this was marked as a water park but it had closed and our  year old daughter was very upset the maid was very rude and told us our feet sunk i would like my money back

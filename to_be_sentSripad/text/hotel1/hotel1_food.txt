the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day
nice hotel very clear good pool for relax very good food and nice small pub next to the street with live music only  min walk to to sang beach where you can enjoy a lot of shops and restaurant take there long tail boat to railway beach where is amazing nature or to para sang bear by long tail boat or by walk  nice place can wait to go to oh santa
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
location is good with a fairly good walking distance to the beach and food outlets
the only point which was a bit disappointing to us was the price level for food and drinks compared to the prices outside the hotel we understand that they have to be a bit more expensive to cover for all other costs the hotel incur but the level was a bit too high under these circumstances and in that surrounding it basically matched german prices with some items even exceeding them
only can say that the prices are a little on the high side for thailand however food is amazing but could do with more offers and promotions and better happy hours
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
getting run down slightly overpriced the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired  cold coffee no western food to speak of better to go to one of the many other cases in the area
would have liked warm bacon at breakfast other than that great selection of food
should be more that food on the menu not interested in italian food in thailand
the beach was a bit rocky and its limited in food choice
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
breakfast was a disappointment  quality of food is not up to the price level low quality oil make any omelet incredible cheapest white bread etc breakfast room did not have enough space and efficient staff created even more chaos no self service for tea or coffee  that creates a long waiting time sometimes we had to ask  times staff do not speak and do not fully understand english so it makes it a bit complicated
cleanliness of the private plunge pool food was overpriced
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better
was mislead about family room near pool had to pay to upgrade up a very very steep hill food was very poor sister hotel food was outstanding
a little expensive for the evening meal but quality of food was good
every thing the staff were brilliant food and drink fantastic and the resort beautiful
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
well kept beach quickly rooms and right on the beach great place to stay restaurant was full of option and nice food
there was by night on the beach with live music fire dance and good food highly recommend to anyone it was a great fun and hats of to band which were to best among all other option in oh same
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you arenâ€™t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back

excellent place to relax away from it all  food was gorgeous and easy to book onward travel from here

everything was great super rooms great food and drinks very friendly and helpful staff beach facilities was the best and the hotel was in perfect distance from town in a quiet relaxed area easy to get in to chewing with a taxi we will be back
great location in the heart of chewing  minute walk to the beach few minutes away from the main nighttime super friendly and helpful staff and a very nice bar to relax eat drink and play some pool or watch sports
the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day

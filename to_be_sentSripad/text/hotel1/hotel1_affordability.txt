resort feels tired probably  years past its best rooms not particularly well  cleaned towels and linen a little ruby wifi not great breakfast dull guests are politely forced to leave loungers and bean bags at any time from    to make room for evening dining tables on the beach  which during our stay at least were hardly used booked a standard room which was horrible  dark and just not comfortable  the door and window fitting had huge gaps allowing many mosquitoes into the room each night asked if i could pay for a better room for the remainder of stay and was told nothing was available so looked on bookingcom and saw that  superior rooms seemed to be free for the duration of stay when i showed the staff they eventually agreed a change of room it shouldn have been that difficult oh and booked and paid for a transfer from the airport on arrival which didn show up  an admit error on the hotels partner great after  hours of traveling and didn really feel the apology was adequate i guess it was a last minute budget option  but reinforced for me that its worth paying a bit more for real comfort and quality
the only point which was a bit disappointing to us was the price level for food and drinks compared to the prices outside the hotel we understand that they have to be a bit more expensive to cover for all other costs the hotel incur but the level was a bit too high under these circumstances and in that surrounding it basically matched german prices with some items even exceeding them
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
the rooms have seen better days but are still okay our superior room was big the iron broke twice but was fixed the same day our telephone want working as well but got replaced the same day as well the breakfast at the hotel is really expensive
the location is far from everything oh same taxi is very expensive we paid  bath for reach next hotel to hostel taxi
excursions proposed by the hotel were a little on the expensive side would recommend organizing directly with the service provides
a little expensive for the evening meal but quality of food was good
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
i loved the ease  of the bungalow position as we could move quickly to the beach the pool and the breakfast area and still be close to the main road and all the cheap restaurant the gardens were lovely and the bungalows very comfortable
the food was ok quite expensive but acceptable
staff were really helpful good location in lamp across from night market  decent pools with lots of sun loungers we booked for  days and stayed an extra  lamp was very quiet during our stay but not expensive to get share taxi to chewing for night out
wonderful beach nice spot very cheap nice included breakfast efficient service close to the city center in it nice motor renting

the owners of the hotel are exceptional hosts italian hospitality at its best anything a traveller may need they can help

the staffowner went above and beyond to help i had forgotten some important documents in the room i rented and gone off to to to once i realized i that i had forgotten my documents i tried to call and explain my situation but the connection was poor  days later i made my way back to the river beach hotel but it was closed it was the off season and they were having some repairs done luckily for me the  wonderful ladies that work at julia penza which has excellent food and service that is right next door to the river came to my aid they asked around and found someone that had the telephone number to the owner of the river and called her for me the owner of the river agreed to come to meet me and let me into the room but that it would take more than  minutes to get to there since she lived far away  i waited at julia penza and had taste meal and enjoyed a beautiful sunset from their terrace on the beach the person from the river showed up and let me into the room and i found my documents right where i had hidden them i tried to give them a reward for taking the time to come let me in but she would not take any money i cannot thank them enough both the folks at the river and at julia penza were tremendous helpful

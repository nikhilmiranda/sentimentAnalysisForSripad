restaurant staff asked extra money for offering plates and spoon for the room
the staff were friendly and helpful in allowing us to check in an hour early
we reached the hotel around  to pm there a slight hiccup during checking which we were told to wait around mind for the rooms to be ready  maintenance should be carried out frequently and the hotel really need to improve on the housekeeping went out in the morning and came back to the hotel around pm but our rooms were not cleaned despite indicating the make up room sign had to call reception for them to clean the room and it happened throughout our stay
very nice and brand new hotel super clean friendly staff and free parking provided great breakfast we had a pool access room which was amazing
the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day
nice swimming poolvery kind and friendly staff
cleanliness  staff location
the beds are super come staff are amazing
most things about the hotel clean in a great position and the staff were great
all good front office staff excellent
my birthday was on the day of check in and i was a bit disappointed that i did not even get a happy birthday from any of the staff members even though they were standing there with my passport and birth date even when one of my friends said something about it they still did not acknowledge it i don´t care about free stuff but it would have been nice if they would have at least wished me a good day
the hotel looks and feels quite new it is very nice and clean the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff were all very friendly the breakfast is nice and has most of the alternatives you want while the beach is only about a  minute walk away and there are plenty of restaurant  cases  bars in the street right outside the hotel
the hotel was clean staff was helpful and location was superb
the bed is very comfortable staff is very friendly and happy to helps you on any request
location was really good super close to the beach and all restaurant etc front desk staff were nice and helpful at  check in bed was come and room was clean
the breakfast was ok and staff was nice too
staff are very helpful
nicely located friendly and helpful staff good value for money upgrade our room free of charge because of our honeymoon
loved the location staff were lovely pool was fabulous and rooms were nice and fresh and modern and clean only  minute walk to beach if that
nice staff great pool location great
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
view from room facing another hotel which is not great for privacy we called reception in an evening to bring up two wine glasses and they refused to do it and asked us to go down to the bar and pick it up by ourselves
service has gone done in the past  months bad mixed at check in that should never have been allowed to happen at a  star hotel poor cleaning and restoring of rooms not enough staff to handle the customers no iron or iron board available very disappointed as our first stay was great but this time it was not living up to our previous experience of the hotel not sure we will want to book this hotel again
big swimming pool comfortable bed great location the staff are really enthusiastic
spacious rooms modern design accommodation staff
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
clean big room nice staff
the hotel was very modern and the room was very spacious it is also just over a  minute walk to the beach which is great staff were also amazing with everything
resort feels tired probably  years past its best rooms not particularly well  cleaned towels and linen a little ruby wifi not great breakfast dull guests are politely forced to leave loungers and bean bags at any time from    to make room for evening dining tables on the beach  which during our stay at least were hardly used booked a standard room which was horrible  dark and just not comfortable  the door and window fitting had huge gaps allowing many mosquitoes into the room each night asked if i could pay for a better room for the remainder of stay and was told nothing was available so looked on bookingcom and saw that  superior rooms seemed to be free for the duration of stay when i showed the staff they eventually agreed a change of room it shouldn have been that difficult oh and booked and paid for a transfer from the airport on arrival which didn show up  an admit error on the hotels partner great after  hours of traveling and didn really feel the apology was adequate i guess it was a last minute budget option  but reinforced for me that its worth paying a bit more for real comfort and quality
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
noisy rude staff dirty uncomfortable
didn find the front office staff very helpful or friendly everything seemed an issue for them
the mattress was broken we suffered two nights but staff not change it only turned it over to the other side it was more better but not enough good for sleeping
no proper beach to swim in  the so called free massage were done with clothes on at one point when asked for a  bottle of wine to take back to the room there was no stock when i complained to the manager he said he placed an order for  bottles  they were coming in  weeks  he said he’d get me one “outside” for a very “good” price this is supposed to be a  star hotel  and there were bull ants in the condiments staff in reception didn’t seem to know a lot about their surroundings to give the tourist any into no entertainment especially at night or activities hotel stuck out away from everything at least  mind to half hour scuttle to anything
old design old fashion design ugly pool design villas very close next to another the same with sun beds and these beds in white were so old that looks grey n black i didn touch them  really disgusting staff knowledge of english on basic level  not nicer then average not saying hello when passing you breakfast rather less than average for me overpriced but its oh same  in general renovation needed with a good interior designer
one of the staff by the pool could have helped us carry our luggage which we dragged up from the beach having just come off a boat
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
the wifi was very difficult to connect to maybe because i was in a room at the back of the resort also when i asked for assistance getting the wifi to work the member of staff told me he would come to my room but never did since wifi was the least of my worries i didn pursue the issue any further and spent most of my time exploring the island
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
one staff member was really impolite there a lot of noise turning the night if there any sport event going on in the world
bigger problem was a few guests drinking from glass bottles in the swimming pool if one broke the entire pool would have to be emptied to ensure every last piece of glass was removed i did bring this to the attention of reception who thanked me but did nothing

the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
poor service staff poorly trained and inexperienced offer little more than the standard answers no converge service
the owner a russian guy i think working reception in the evening came across as bored and grumpywhen i asked if he could change a bath note i needed a couple of bath notes for local shop he obliged with a  and  and was definitely not happy about doing that
breakfast was a disappointment  quality of food is not up to the price level low quality oil make any omelet incredible cheapest white bread etc breakfast room did not have enough space and efficient staff created even more chaos no self service for tea or coffee  that creates a long waiting time sometimes we had to ask  times staff do not speak and do not fully understand english so it makes it a bit complicated
there could have been access to some staff at night
we had no hot water on our first night from pm due to internal works on their water system and we weren’t informed when we checked in we found out by a note that was left on our bed no staff had told us of this which was disappointing the water was supposed to be back on from pm the cold water worked after this time however still after pm we had no hot water and the cold water from the sink was spitting out a yellow colour we were changed to a different room that night after complaining to the converge they did however give us two free cocktail voucher also disappointed breakfast was not served until after am which isn’t ideal if you have an early morning flight and have paid for the buffets breakfast  we asked for a coffee around am and was told staff wouldn’t make one until after am we expected more from a  star resort
mosquitoes please take care of it they were a big pain outside or inside the room staff behavior could have been more inviting than present and lastly the cocktail were devoid of alcohol all the drinks were a complete cheat
there was no in room safe although safety deposit boxes were available at the reception which you had to buy a lock for  in assuming they have learnt from mistakes with the room safes
it raised quite badly whilst we were there and the villa leaned water in so badly that we had to mop up the water as it was heading towards our belongings and the bed there was also water leaking through the ceiling as the roof times had blown off we called the hotel reception two times to be told they would send someone down to us but no one came they were only gathered about what colour towels we were using to mop up the water my partner had to go to reception in the end and get someone down they weren’t that gathered about what had happened and explained we should have put the blind down that was outside on the balcony unfortunately this was never explained to us when we arrived plus if we had been out for the day we wouldn’t have put the blind down expecting it it rain the manager basically made out like it was our fault not what you expect when you pay over £ pounds per night i would have expected some sort of good will gesture but we got nothing
staff were pleasant and friendly but completely unresponsiveforgetful with any requests  for example we needed toilet paper called the front desk  hours later still no toilet paper
staff never smiled rooms appalling dirty and no privacy
foreign staff want as friendly as that staff not very accommodation
the room was a long walk from reception since i have a health condition i would have liked to know that heading in
the friendly atmosphere and staff being right by the beach good wifi and very helpful staff
excellent experience hotel and staff where brilliant
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the staff where always smiling and keen to help anyway they could
very nice staff nice see view great sea great breakfast also for began beautiful garden around hotel walking distance to restaurant and shops
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
wonderful and helpful staff copy atmosphere
lovely staff really helpful
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
every thing the staff were brilliant food and drink fantastic and the resort beautiful
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the staff is really nice
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
we traveled as a group of  people had a nice and spacious clean triple room which was located to the side street top floor the owner hotel manager and staff were very friendly and attentive gave us many good recommendations and offered us nice trips for really good price we really enjoyed our stay and can recommend it to other travelers
friendly and helpful staff always happy to organise transfers and booking breakfast was also worth adding to the booking
extremely friendly and accommodation staff good proximity to fisherman village lovely room
the bed was hard but we asked for a copper at reception which made the bed more comfortable
my hint would be when you check in they will ask you if you want to take out a loyalty card with them  it can be a benefit so its worth considering but you have no idea to what value as they dont give you any cost information  my advice would be to tell then you want to think about it and then head to the pool bar to check out the menu and prices  then work out what you think you might typically spend in a day and calculate what the total spend might be for your stay   you can then go back to reception and take out the card that works for you
rooms were large beds comfortable  do not accept room  near reception noisy and basically no privacy  staff were accommodation when we requested room change  always request upstairs rooms for privacy  we had deluge terrace not worth the additional money  superior rooms more than adequate our friends had one  we only sighted one standalone cottage and again would not pay the extra for this room
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
staff was extremely courteous
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
staff were all very accommodation and helpful overall i did enjoy my stay here i just think your room needs serious improvement to meet expectations
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
great room great pool and bar friendly staff
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good
great staff good location
excellent food very friendly and helpful staff super nice and clean bungalow deluge pool very convenient with restaurant beach and pool so its easy with kiss
we absolutely loved our stay at smile house the staff were super helpful and friendly and we looked forward to the delirious breakfast every morning
everything very nice staff clean perfect for what you pay close to the beach restaurant pharmacies convenience stores etc
staff were amazing good location
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
clean peaceful place staff is good
comfort of the villaroom garden of the hotel smile of the team the pool area and view breakfast quiet place

the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming the breakfast was amazing fresh fruits everyday eggs cooked on the spot salt dishes varied from day to day rooms were huge the whole hotel was spotless as the staff is constantly cleaning loved this hotel its location is great so close to the beach and close to the main road the food even ordered outside breakfast is also incredible quality much better than most of the restaurant around the pool bar was great to chill at also
harry and his team at reception did a fantastic job super friendly and will to assist wherever possible the hotel is rewarded with great staff housekeeping did a great job along with the bar and restaurant staff great place for the young at heart party all day from  am
transfer jenny from reception breakfasts room big comfortable bed beach is amazing

the staff was wonderful  there is no elevator  the staff carried our luggage to the rooms so it want a chose for us  i felt sorry for the staff  it included an asia breakfast  it was delicious and the lady that served us made it very pleasant  it was a good experience
the rooms were lovely and modern the staff were very friendly and went the extra mile to ensure your stay was a comfortable one the breakfast was without doubt the best i had during my travels in thailand

l like my stay in indiana very nice food view clean free bus scuttle to chewing nice pool nice activities in the restaurant and staff are friendly
the rooms and the views are beautiful very friendly staff sea service was very goodge had a relaxed and pleasant stay
we stayed eight nights at scent hotel it was an enjoyable experience and my partner and i enjoyed our stay the room is the same as you can see from the photo the only difference is that it is a bit smaller the bed was very come the bath products were excellent and it smells lavender in the room and throughout the hotel which was a nice touch as for the reception and restaurant staff they are all friendly and deliver an excellent service the breakfast was nice i can say that the food is a now but its ok we checked their sea and it was pretty average  there are better places for sea treatments in a close walking proximity the beach is private however it is muddy in the water so you can swim but its not pleasant the hotel is close to fisherman village and its a good bonus as there are many nice restaurant and the best coffee in same you can easily access chewing and other parts of the island by tut tut and taxi though taxi drivers dont want to use the matter and you need to bargain an every ride price the other bonus is scent guest relationship manager it was overcast and rainy weather during our stay and he suggested us things to do thanks to him
everything they gave us a free upgrade and we had a private pool facilities and staff were amazing
good location beach is close and amazing views staff friendly
the staff

restaurant staff asked extra money for offering plates and spoon for the room
the staff were friendly and helpful in allowing us to check in an hour early
we reached the hotel around  to pm there a slight hiccup during checking which we were told to wait around mind for the rooms to be ready  maintenance should be carried out frequently and the hotel really need to improve on the housekeeping went out in the morning and came back to the hotel around pm but our rooms were not cleaned despite indicating the make up room sign had to call reception for them to clean the room and it happened throughout our stay
very nice and brand new hotel super clean friendly staff and free parking provided great breakfast we had a pool access room which was amazing
the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day

the hotel was very modern and the room was very spacious it is also just over a  minute walk to the beach which is great staff were also amazing with everything

food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
noisy rude staff dirty uncomfortable
didn find the front office staff very helpful or friendly everything seemed an issue for them
the mattress was broken we suffered two nights but staff not change it only turned it over to the other side it was more better but not enough good for sleeping
no proper beach to swim in  the so called free massage were done with clothes on at one point when asked for a  bottle of wine to take back to the room there was no stock when i complained to the manager he said he placed an order for  bottles  they were coming in  weeks  he said he’d get me one “outside” for a very “good” price this is supposed to be a  star hotel  and there were bull ants in the condiments staff in reception didn’t seem to know a lot about their surroundings to give the tourist any into no entertainment especially at night or activities hotel stuck out away from everything at least  mind to half hour scuttle to anything
old design old fashion design ugly pool design villas very close next to another the same with sun beds and these beds in white were so old that looks grey n black i didn touch them  really disgusting staff knowledge of english on basic level  not nicer then average not saying hello when passing you breakfast rather less than average for me overpriced but its oh same  in general renovation needed with a good interior designer
one of the staff by the pool could have helped us carry our luggage which we dragged up from the beach having just come off a boat
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
the wifi was very difficult to connect to maybe because i was in a room at the back of the resort also when i asked for assistance getting the wifi to work the member of staff told me he would come to my room but never did since wifi was the least of my worries i didn pursue the issue any further and spent most of my time exploring the island
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
one staff member was really impolite there a lot of noise turning the night if there any sport event going on in the world
bigger problem was a few guests drinking from glass bottles in the swimming pool if one broke the entire pool would have to be emptied to ensure every last piece of glass was removed i did bring this to the attention of reception who thanked me but did nothing

the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
poor service staff poorly trained and inexperienced offer little more than the standard answers no converge service
the owner a russian guy i think working reception in the evening came across as bored and grumpywhen i asked if he could change a bath note i needed a couple of bath notes for local shop he obliged with a  and  and was definitely not happy about doing that
breakfast was a disappointment  quality of food is not up to the price level low quality oil make any omelet incredible cheapest white bread etc breakfast room did not have enough space and efficient staff created even more chaos no self service for tea or coffee  that creates a long waiting time sometimes we had to ask  times staff do not speak and do not fully understand english so it makes it a bit complicated
there could have been access to some staff at night
we had no hot water on our first night from pm due to internal works on their water system and we weren’t informed when we checked in we found out by a note that was left on our bed no staff had told us of this which was disappointing the water was supposed to be back on from pm the cold water worked after this time however still after pm we had no hot water and the cold water from the sink was spitting out a yellow colour we were changed to a different room that night after complaining to the converge they did however give us two free cocktail voucher also disappointed breakfast was not served until after am which isn’t ideal if you have an early morning flight and have paid for the buffets breakfast  we asked for a coffee around am and was told staff wouldn’t make one until after am we expected more from a  star resort
mosquitoes please take care of it they were a big pain outside or inside the room staff behavior could have been more inviting than present and lastly the cocktail were devoid of alcohol all the drinks were a complete cheat
there was no in room safe although safety deposit boxes were available at the reception which you had to buy a lock for  in assuming they have learnt from mistakes with the room safes
it raised quite badly whilst we were there and the villa leaned water in so badly that we had to mop up the water as it was heading towards our belongings and the bed there was also water leaking through the ceiling as the roof times had blown off we called the hotel reception two times to be told they would send someone down to us but no one came they were only gathered about what colour towels we were using to mop up the water my partner had to go to reception in the end and get someone down they weren’t that gathered about what had happened and explained we should have put the blind down that was outside on the balcony unfortunately this was never explained to us when we arrived plus if we had been out for the day we wouldn’t have put the blind down expecting it it rain the manager basically made out like it was our fault not what you expect when you pay over £ pounds per night i would have expected some sort of good will gesture but we got nothing
staff were pleasant and friendly but completely unresponsiveforgetful with any requests  for example we needed toilet paper called the front desk  hours later still no toilet paper
staff never smiled rooms appalling dirty and no privacy
foreign staff want as friendly as that staff not very accommodation
the room was a long walk from reception since i have a health condition i would have liked to know that heading in
the friendly atmosphere and staff being right by the beach good wifi and very helpful staff
excellent experience hotel and staff where brilliant
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the staff where always smiling and keen to help anyway they could
very nice staff nice see view great sea great breakfast also for began beautiful garden around hotel walking distance to restaurant and shops
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
wonderful and helpful staff copy atmosphere
lovely staff really helpful
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
every thing the staff were brilliant food and drink fantastic and the resort beautiful
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the staff is really nice
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
we traveled as a group of  people had a nice and spacious clean triple room which was located to the side street top floor the owner hotel manager and staff were very friendly and attentive gave us many good recommendations and offered us nice trips for really good price we really enjoyed our stay and can recommend it to other travelers
friendly and helpful staff always happy to organise transfers and booking breakfast was also worth adding to the booking
extremely friendly and accommodation staff good proximity to fisherman village lovely room
the bed was hard but we asked for a copper at reception which made the bed more comfortable
my hint would be when you check in they will ask you if you want to take out a loyalty card with them  it can be a benefit so its worth considering but you have no idea to what value as they dont give you any cost information  my advice would be to tell then you want to think about it and then head to the pool bar to check out the menu and prices  then work out what you think you might typically spend in a day and calculate what the total spend might be for your stay   you can then go back to reception and take out the card that works for you
rooms were large beds comfortable  do not accept room  near reception noisy and basically no privacy  staff were accommodation when we requested room change  always request upstairs rooms for privacy  we had deluge terrace not worth the additional money  superior rooms more than adequate our friends had one  we only sighted one standalone cottage and again would not pay the extra for this room
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
staff was extremely courteous
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
staff were all very accommodation and helpful overall i did enjoy my stay here i just think your room needs serious improvement to meet expectations
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
great room great pool and bar friendly staff
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good
great staff good location

everything very nice staff clean perfect for what you pay close to the beach restaurant pharmacies convenience stores etc
staff were amazing good location
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
clean peaceful place staff is good

harry and his team at reception did a fantastic job super friendly and will to assist wherever possible the hotel is rewarded with great staff housekeeping did a great job along with the bar and restaurant staff great place for the young at heart party all day from  am

the staff was wonderful  there is no elevator  the staff carried our luggage to the rooms so it want a chose for us  i felt sorry for the staff  it included an asia breakfast  it was delicious and the lady that served us made it very pleasant  it was a good experience
the rooms were lovely and modern the staff were very friendly and went the extra mile to ensure your stay was a comfortable one the breakfast was without doubt the best i had during my travels in thailand
friendly staff this was my second time there
l like my stay in indiana very nice food view clean free bus scuttle to chewing nice pool nice activities in the restaurant and staff are friendly
the rooms and the views are beautiful very friendly staff sea service was very goodge had a relaxed and pleasant stay
we stayed eight nights at scent hotel it was an enjoyable experience and my partner and i enjoyed our stay the room is the same as you can see from the photo the only difference is that it is a bit smaller the bed was very come the bath products were excellent and it smells lavender in the room and throughout the hotel which was a nice touch as for the reception and restaurant staff they are all friendly and deliver an excellent service the breakfast was nice i can say that the food is a now but its ok we checked their sea and it was pretty average  there are better places for sea treatments in a close walking proximity the beach is private however it is muddy in the water so you can swim but its not pleasant the hotel is close to fisherman village and its a good bonus as there are many nice restaurant and the best coffee in same you can easily access chewing and other parts of the island by tut tut and taxi though taxi drivers dont want to use the matter and you need to bargain an every ride price the other bonus is scent guest relationship manager it was overcast and rainy weather during our stay and he suggested us things to do thanks to him
everything they gave us a free upgrade and we had a private pool facilities and staff were amazing
good location beach is close and amazing views staff friendly
the staff
staff were friendly and helpful only ate food once at the hotel but it was very nice room was beautiful with a lovely bathroom the to had a large variety of english to on it unlike a lot of other hotels who had no english channels which was good for when we had went to bed

great location in the heart of chewing  minute walk to the beach few minutes away from the main nighttime super friendly and helpful staff and a very nice bar to relax eat drink and play some pool or watch sports
the hotel was well maintained with a good  clean rooms housekeeping very good pool attendants and bar staff very  helpful
all staff were very friendly responsive to our questions and needs and the owners scored many bonus points by surprising us by presenting a beautiful and taste birthday cake for my wife we would love to go back
location friendly staff nice breakfast
there is nothing wrong with this resort it s simply perfect staff location and facilities are excellent and if i ever come back again to to same i already know where to go you are great
this place was great from check in to our departure the breakfast was excellent and our villa was lovely the staff make it particularly pleasant and went out of their way to help me when i was ill
restaurant staff asked extra money for offering plates and spoon for the room
the staff were friendly and helpful in allowing us to check in an hour early
we reached the hotel around  to pm there a slight hiccup during checking which we were told to wait around mind for the rooms to be ready  maintenance should be carried out frequently and the hotel really need to improve on the housekeeping went out in the morning and came back to the hotel around pm but our rooms were not cleaned despite indicating the make up room sign had to call reception for them to clean the room and it happened throughout our stay
very nice and brand new hotel super clean friendly staff and free parking provided great breakfast we had a pool access room which was amazing
the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day
nice swimming poolvery kind and friendly staff
cleanliness  staff location
the beds are super come staff are amazing
most things about the hotel clean in a great position and the staff were great
all good front office staff excellent
my birthday was on the day of check in and i was a bit disappointed that i did not even get a happy birthday from any of the staff members even though they were standing there with my passport and birth date even when one of my friends said something about it they still did not acknowledge it i don´t care about free stuff but it would have been nice if they would have at least wished me a good day
the hotel looks and feels quite new it is very nice and clean the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff were all very friendly the breakfast is nice and has most of the alternatives you want while the beach is only about a  minute walk away and there are plenty of restaurant  cases  bars in the street right outside the hotel
the hotel was clean staff was helpful and location was superb
the bed is very comfortable staff is very friendly and happy to helps you on any request
location was really good super close to the beach and all restaurant etc front desk staff were nice and helpful at  check in bed was come and room was clean
the breakfast was ok and staff was nice too
staff are very helpful
nicely located friendly and helpful staff good value for money upgrade our room free of charge because of our honeymoon
loved the location staff were lovely pool was fabulous and rooms were nice and fresh and modern and clean only  minute walk to beach if that
nice staff great pool location great
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
view from room facing another hotel which is not great for privacy we called reception in an evening to bring up two wine glasses and they refused to do it and asked us to go down to the bar and pick it up by ourselves
service has gone done in the past  months bad mixed at check in that should never have been allowed to happen at a  star hotel poor cleaning and restoring of rooms not enough staff to handle the customers no iron or iron board available very disappointed as our first stay was great but this time it was not living up to our previous experience of the hotel not sure we will want to book this hotel again
big swimming pool comfortable bed great location the staff are really enthusiastic
spacious rooms modern design accommodation staff
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
clean big room nice staff
the hotel was very modern and the room was very spacious it is also just over a  minute walk to the beach which is great staff were also amazing with everything
resort feels tired probably  years past its best rooms not particularly well  cleaned towels and linen a little ruby wifi not great breakfast dull guests are politely forced to leave loungers and bean bags at any time from    to make room for evening dining tables on the beach  which during our stay at least were hardly used booked a standard room which was horrible  dark and just not comfortable  the door and window fitting had huge gaps allowing many mosquitoes into the room each night asked if i could pay for a better room for the remainder of stay and was told nothing was available so looked on bookingcom and saw that  superior rooms seemed to be free for the duration of stay when i showed the staff they eventually agreed a change of room it shouldn have been that difficult oh and booked and paid for a transfer from the airport on arrival which didn show up  an admit error on the hotels partner great after  hours of traveling and didn really feel the apology was adequate i guess it was a last minute budget option  but reinforced for me that its worth paying a bit more for real comfort and quality
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
noisy rude staff dirty uncomfortable
didn find the front office staff very helpful or friendly everything seemed an issue for them
the mattress was broken we suffered two nights but staff not change it only turned it over to the other side it was more better but not enough good for sleeping
no proper beach to swim in  the so called free massage were done with clothes on at one point when asked for a  bottle of wine to take back to the room there was no stock when i complained to the manager he said he placed an order for  bottles  they were coming in  weeks  he said he’d get me one “outside” for a very “good” price this is supposed to be a  star hotel  and there were bull ants in the condiments staff in reception didn’t seem to know a lot about their surroundings to give the tourist any into no entertainment especially at night or activities hotel stuck out away from everything at least  mind to half hour scuttle to anything
old design old fashion design ugly pool design villas very close next to another the same with sun beds and these beds in white were so old that looks grey n black i didn touch them  really disgusting staff knowledge of english on basic level  not nicer then average not saying hello when passing you breakfast rather less than average for me overpriced but its oh same  in general renovation needed with a good interior designer
one of the staff by the pool could have helped us carry our luggage which we dragged up from the beach having just come off a boat
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
the wifi was very difficult to connect to maybe because i was in a room at the back of the resort also when i asked for assistance getting the wifi to work the member of staff told me he would come to my room but never did since wifi was the least of my worries i didn pursue the issue any further and spent most of my time exploring the island
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
one staff member was really impolite there a lot of noise turning the night if there any sport event going on in the world
bigger problem was a few guests drinking from glass bottles in the swimming pool if one broke the entire pool would have to be emptied to ensure every last piece of glass was removed i did bring this to the attention of reception who thanked me but did nothing

there could have been access to some staff at night
we had no hot water on our first night from pm due to internal works on their water system and we weren’t informed when we checked in we found out by a note that was left on our bed no staff had told us of this which was disappointing the water was supposed to be back on from pm the cold water worked after this time however still after pm we had no hot water and the cold water from the sink was spitting out a yellow colour we were changed to a different room that night after complaining to the converge they did however give us two free cocktail voucher also disappointed breakfast was not served until after am which isn’t ideal if you have an early morning flight and have paid for the buffets breakfast  we asked for a coffee around am and was told staff wouldn’t make one until after am we expected more from a  star resort
mosquitoes please take care of it they were a big pain outside or inside the room staff behavior could have been more inviting than present and lastly the cocktail were devoid of alcohol all the drinks were a complete cheat
there was no in room safe although safety deposit boxes were available at the reception which you had to buy a lock for  in assuming they have learnt from mistakes with the room safes
it raised quite badly whilst we were there and the villa leaned water in so badly that we had to mop up the water as it was heading towards our belongings and the bed there was also water leaking through the ceiling as the roof times had blown off we called the hotel reception two times to be told they would send someone down to us but no one came they were only gathered about what colour towels we were using to mop up the water my partner had to go to reception in the end and get someone down they weren’t that gathered about what had happened and explained we should have put the blind down that was outside on the balcony unfortunately this was never explained to us when we arrived plus if we had been out for the day we wouldn’t have put the blind down expecting it it rain the manager basically made out like it was our fault not what you expect when you pay over £ pounds per night i would have expected some sort of good will gesture but we got nothing
staff were pleasant and friendly but completely unresponsiveforgetful with any requests  for example we needed toilet paper called the front desk  hours later still no toilet paper
staff never smiled rooms appalling dirty and no privacy
foreign staff want as friendly as that staff not very accommodation
the room was a long walk from reception since i have a health condition i would have liked to know that heading in
the friendly atmosphere and staff being right by the beach good wifi and very helpful staff
excellent experience hotel and staff where brilliant
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the staff where always smiling and keen to help anyway they could
very nice staff nice see view great sea great breakfast also for began beautiful garden around hotel walking distance to restaurant and shops
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
wonderful and helpful staff copy atmosphere
lovely staff really helpful
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
every thing the staff were brilliant food and drink fantastic and the resort beautiful
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the staff is really nice
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
we traveled as a group of  people had a nice and spacious clean triple room which was located to the side street top floor the owner hotel manager and staff were very friendly and attentive gave us many good recommendations and offered us nice trips for really good price we really enjoyed our stay and can recommend it to other travelers
friendly and helpful staff always happy to organise transfers and booking breakfast was also worth adding to the booking
extremely friendly and accommodation staff good proximity to fisherman village lovely room
the bed was hard but we asked for a copper at reception which made the bed more comfortable
my hint would be when you check in they will ask you if you want to take out a loyalty card with them  it can be a benefit so its worth considering but you have no idea to what value as they dont give you any cost information  my advice would be to tell then you want to think about it and then head to the pool bar to check out the menu and prices  then work out what you think you might typically spend in a day and calculate what the total spend might be for your stay   you can then go back to reception and take out the card that works for you
rooms were large beds comfortable  do not accept room  near reception noisy and basically no privacy  staff were accommodation when we requested room change  always request upstairs rooms for privacy  we had deluge terrace not worth the additional money  superior rooms more than adequate our friends had one  we only sighted one standalone cottage and again would not pay the extra for this room
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
staff was extremely courteous
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
staff were all very accommodation and helpful overall i did enjoy my stay here i just think your room needs serious improvement to meet expectations
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
great room great pool and bar friendly staff
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good

like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself

l like my stay in indiana very nice food view clean free bus scuttle to chewing nice pool nice activities in the restaurant and staff are friendly
the rooms and the views are beautiful very friendly staff sea service was very goodge had a relaxed and pleasant stay
we stayed eight nights at scent hotel it was an enjoyable experience and my partner and i enjoyed our stay the room is the same as you can see from the photo the only difference is that it is a bit smaller the bed was very come the bath products were excellent and it smells lavender in the room and throughout the hotel which was a nice touch as for the reception and restaurant staff they are all friendly and deliver an excellent service the breakfast was nice i can say that the food is a now but its ok we checked their sea and it was pretty average  there are better places for sea treatments in a close walking proximity the beach is private however it is muddy in the water so you can swim but its not pleasant the hotel is close to fisherman village and its a good bonus as there are many nice restaurant and the best coffee in same you can easily access chewing and other parts of the island by tut tut and taxi though taxi drivers dont want to use the matter and you need to bargain an every ride price the other bonus is scent guest relationship manager it was overcast and rainy weather during our stay and he suggested us things to do thanks to him

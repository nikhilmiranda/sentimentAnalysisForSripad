breakfast was very good pool was fine room was a good size view of hillside was what we requested easy to get in and out as wished rented mop and easy parking right in front of hotel nice little pop up bar although did not sit down to enjoy at least somebody did location was good plenty to offer right outside the door buffets down and across street very good go early starts
the bathroom was not clean when i arrived that is not  star standard my room had view to neighbor hotel with very little privacy
it was really a bad hotel not like the pictures firstly the swimming pool is not clean very dirty and smells like toilet the rooms are too old doors are not closing air condition was working loudly that we cannot sleep the sea was so poor i  booked  min message but they only do for  min and not a good one it was total a disaster all guests and workers are so rude they always shout at swimming pool housekeeping shouts doors so wakes you up in the morning so do not think to stay at this look quality hotel
view from room facing another hotel which is not great for privacy we called reception in an evening to bring up two wine glasses and they refused to do it and asked us to go down to the bar and pick it up by ourselves
pool area felt like a package holiday no real view from the balcony
room directly opened up to another hotel not the best view
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
bed wasn’t the best as it was two singles pushed together and the pillows were hard not much of a view from the balcony on ground floor
the garden view is a view to a construction site
i have reserved an ocean view villa and i pay more but i get partial ocean view villa and no one get me my money back and once you spoke to them they make them self stupid its all thailand like this they concern for your money and once you pay no one will take care of you
the buildings are starting to look a bit tired in some places the pool villa we had v was looking tired in the bathroom area
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
the hotel was not as pictured on bookingcom the hotel its self was really run down and forgotten about in my opinion was probably too big to maintain the restaurant area was dirty as were the pools which we never used for that reason it showed beautiful  possibly  infinity pools in photo but in reality one was out of action and the others were to a poor standard the hotel had very few guests and the few that were there didn use facilities either as there were nobody on sun loungers or in pools the grm also pictured on the sight was of poor quality too really old equipment this was one of the reasons i booked this particular hotel a real shame as i thought best western hotel had some kind of reputation to keep on whole disappointing
some pool chair cushions are quite worn for a  star hotel wooden dealing is starting to look feathered and could use a coat of varnish
needed some maintenance in the rooms starting to look a little tired couldn get  keys for the room
very nice staff nice see view great sea great breakfast also for began beautiful garden around hotel walking distance to restaurant and shops
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
everything specially the view

the service and the facilities and the view
pools although a bit tired could use some refurbishing the view to the sea was great you can be in the pool looking at the beach it had a safe the extra bed was a decent bed although it seems they have particular rooms with permanent extra beds the masseuses right at the beach were great it had a restaurant but we didn try it
scuttle bus golf cart sea view jungle life pools
sea view villa with plunge pool was very spacious house keeping was timely there were all amenities we could possibly ask for with fresh scented towels every day if we neededgreat variety of meals at terrace restaurant for dinner as well as room service though it is a bit prices in comparison to to same restaurantsflower decorations left for us on the bed since it was a special occasionfresh fruit every day presented in a wooden bowl complimentary
the hotel is amazing the room we stayed was fabulous with a great view of the ocean the beach is great very calm with few people the restaurant in the hotel is very good many good option and great price you can rent a motorcycle in the hotel which can be a good a way to go around the island
the grounds and setting of the hotel were beautiful the view from the pool was spectacular
amazing view from the restaurant and swimming pool
our second visit something we have never done before renaissance oh same is exceptional the staff are awesome and we couldn recommend the ocean view villa highly enough we requested and were even given outstanding service the same room as we had first time exceptionally private with absolute ocean frontal its own beach and just oozing the romantic tropical experience anyone could ever hope for the grounds are a garden paradise  lush and green and so beautifully designed and maintained they give such an uplifting soft and enveloping feel to your stay a big thank you to ken putnam dew tony and sugar and all the other staff who made our stay so incredible the twain restaurant rooftop with a view would have to rate as the most intimate private hideaway dining spot we have ever enjoyed the service exceptional and attention to detail amazing so relaxed yet so consummate professional a breakfast to die for starts each day perfectly and from the start of your stay to the reluctant end you are made to feel valued and  appreciated as an individual and couple

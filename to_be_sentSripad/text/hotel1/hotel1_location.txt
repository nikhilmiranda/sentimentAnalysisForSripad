breakfast was very good pool was fine room was a good size view of hillside was what we requested easy to get in and out as wished rented mop and easy parking right in front of hotel nice little pop up bar although did not sit down to enjoy at least somebody did location was good plenty to offer right outside the door buffets down and across street very good go early starts
location was too good and the pool area was awesome
they didn’t make up the room in the second day we call thousands of time to the room service center then they come after an hour and the shower place was broken floor get all wet was really dangerous
come bed and location is quite strategic its valuable distant to to sang beach and many arteries along the stretch of road outside the hotel
the pool and its area could be over crowded in the peak season
nice hotel very clear good pool for relax very good food and nice small pub next to the street with live music only  min walk to to sang beach where you can enjoy a lot of shops and restaurant take there long tail boat to railway beach where is amazing nature or to para sang bear by long tail boat or by walk  nice place can wait to go to oh santa
cleanliness  staff location
great location good breakfast very nice pool and bar i also enjoyed that massage
loved everything about our stay the hotel was in a good location breakfast was great with loads of variety the pool was a good size with plenty of sun beds
i have been coming to this hotel many times as we love the location and the beds but the place needs an update please take care of loose electric sockets restaurant tables with broken corners that hurt my child and other minor upgrade
the location
everything beds were extremely comfortable pool area was great location to beach about min walk had a wonderful oil massage at one of the two spas new and clean hotel for a very good price
the pool area only has sun from around  am until approximately  pm so unfortunately we could not enjoy the sun at the pool in the late afternoon but as long as you are aware of that it is fine to plan to stay at the beach longer 
we had a pool access room which was in the far corner of the hotel this meant that at the start of the day and at the end of the day between clean the water in corner by our room was oily from all the swimmer lotions also the corner meant that our direct pool access area with sun loungers did not receive any sun also we paid extra for the deluge room and they wanted to charge us extra for the slippers
the location and the safety
the hotel was clean staff was helpful and location was superb
location was really good super close to the beach and all restaurant etc front desk staff were nice and helpful at  check in bed was come and room was clean
the hotel is located in a good location a lot of restaurant nearby
swimming pool was great loads of sunbeam great location plenty on restaurant nearby including a wide selection of hall choice hall selection for breakfast and always a slight variety
loved the location staff were lovely pool was fabulous and rooms were nice and fresh and modern and clean only  minute walk to beach if that
nice staff great pool location great
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
great location good choice of breakfast pool bar great familycouples hotel
room is very big and clean location is good lots of restaurant around quiet swimming pool is a bit too cold but not many people and its very nice to have a bar in it
breakfast and the pool location
location and the room was clean
the location is very central to everything you need a min walking distance to the beach seven eleven next door great restaurant opposite quiet location
big swimming pool comfortable bed great location the staff are really enthusiastic
pool area felt like a package holiday no real view from the balcony
location was within walking distance to bars restaurant and beach
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
very nice breakfast i really can recommend this place
good location restaurant nearby and the beach is a short walk away maybe  mind
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area
location is good with a fairly good walking distance to the beach and food outlets
location bazaar from anywhere also be aware that they do not accept any currency except bath
the room had lot of cockroaches all the time they came from everywhere behind the mirror in the bathroom from the air conditioning not very nice to see and they were all hugethe location is ok not much going on outside the resort you have to take a taxi if you want a place more busy with more restaurant and bars
this is thailand small island off mainland gulf between a nice hotel and the people who live in shanty huts across the road is a shock there are problems with infrastructure water senate etc outlets running into reaches leaves you wondering sea defence not finished remind you this is a third world country with sex tourism a major attraction not really the place for children bulges and weak digestive systems the people however are beautiful and cunningly kind
there no lightning in the shower place it’s dark if you take shower in the evening there is no place to hang  to dry the towels
getting run down slightly overpriced the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired  cold coffee no western food to speak of better to go to one of the many other cases in the area
didn spend much time there so can comment on location or that good base to moveabout
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
was a bit of a walk outside the main area of restaurant and nice reaches maybe  minutes walk
mould small bad wifi dreary location
the buildings are starting to look a bit tired in some places the pool villa we had v was looking tired in the bathroom area
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
the bed and pillow were so hard being thrown off the beach at  and at dinner at  with a glass of wine just ordered the false advertising of live music on the beach every wednesday night the unfriendly people who work there the owner who barely says hello never minds asking if everything is good he just sits at a table close by doing his accounts or on his phone having to always check the bill because there was a mistake everytime and then argue about what was on it our last two days we used the place only for sleeping ask for a taxi and they request  bath grab a taxi on the street and pay  bath  yes the place does not cost a lot but you can still smile and say good morning hello or good evening
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom
lots of bugsused two huge bottles of bug spray to have an okay stay in our previous hotel cleaning took care of it sundry service slow and ineffective and location make sure you rent a car or a bike
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
the location was not as convenient for walking around or for beach access as wed hoped  the free scuttle to the sister hotel at chewing beach was very limited in frequency  we all felt the mistresses were very hard and uncomfortable  it was odd to have the shower in the same room as the toilet
the location is far from everything oh same taxi is very expensive we paid  bath for reach next hotel to hostel taxi
unfortunately its really close to the late night party avenues in so green mange so you will struggle to sleep before am best answer is to keep going until then if there was a way to sound proof this hotel it would be the best accommodation in same in terms of location and comfort
there are rocks inside the water so need to be careful before swim but it is not a problem of hotel just location and also you can pass by about  peters and find awesome entrance to the sea
not the fault of the hotel but sea is not the cleanest in that location found it strange that they allowed cuba diving classes in the pool
sheets not changed for the whole stay of  nights location was quite a way from madam centre  minute walk in c temperatures and  humidity was a bit much best option is to hire a scooterbike from the hotel
the hotel was not as pictured on bookingcom the hotel its self was really run down and forgotten about in my opinion was probably too big to maintain the restaurant area was dirty as were the pools which we never used for that reason it showed beautiful  possibly  infinity pools in photo but in reality one was out of action and the others were to a poor standard the hotel had very few guests and the few that were there didn use facilities either as there were nobody on sun loungers or in pools the grm also pictured on the sight was of poor quality too really old equipment this was one of the reasons i booked this particular hotel a real shame as i thought best western hotel had some kind of reputation to keep on whole disappointing
the location is a little out of town but not a major problem
the hotel rooms are rather old and there are a lot of mosquitoes when you open the door you have to quickly close it buy mosquitoes still come in during house keeping during the day and they are very hard to catch in the room the location is close to fisherman village but that it nothing else there sand on the beach there is very rough sea water quite depressing if i knew the beach and sea are so much worse than ha went i would definitely not stay at this part of the island
outdated dirty dark uncomfortable bed not a nice place every appliance and piece of furniture has not been changed since this place opened bad all round stayed one night and had to leave terrible
the place where i stay no leg to go up so if you travel with handicap or people who are using wellchair very difficult to go up
slight smell in areas but to be expected with old buildings and area
really bad location
i stayed here with my girlfriend we are in our s and the majority of people that stayed here are in the s  dont come here if you are looking to meet other young people location to chewing is about  mind away on a sooner can be a bit of a haste if you are going out most nights
the hotel is linked to the stadium where the boxing takes place every other day so a bit noisy on some days till midnight
bad internet no english to channels except can breakfast every day the same swimming pool to small good location in lamp and on the beach friendly people
fauces at breakfast are in a place where there is no space to put your plate down apparently other guests had complained of the same thing when we mentioned it but the resort manager or owner is not interested to fix it
the hotel needs refurbishment breakfast choice is quite limited took the mind that massage with my husband and completely regretted it requested the massage to be in the comfort of our room but they didn’t allow this other hotels in the area provided this service the massage room was smell and the masseuses was talking to each other most of the time no peace whatsoever our room wasn’t exactly clean there were dirtstain marks all over the bathroom glass door major turn off all in all bad value for money i’ve stayed at apasari hotel are tar and apple a day previously nearby hotels which are way better and cheaper too
hotel is very popular for wedding on the beach and guests are asked not to use the beach when there is a wedding  which i found unreasonable could do with a small selection of water sports facilities like snorkelling equipment maybe some paddle boards some games in the lounge area like cards dominions scramble etcetera would be good
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way
for the price we paid the resort missed the marked it was nice and comfortable but the finer points were missing granted it was off season when we visited so that may be part of the explanation however the experience was pretty average or the amount we paid the location is about  minutes from fisherman village which is beautiful although tourist a major shopping complexarea is just slightly further
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
motion hotel was reasonable rooms were clean and gardens were nice air con worked well  didn try the breakfast but the barrestaurant was nice enough and there is a small pool with some beds should you wish to use it very quiet considering its location
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
the complete stay was perfect calm huge room with everything you need i would definitely recommend this accommodation especially when you looking for a quiet place away from all the party life  bit still you reach the centre of lamp within a few driving minutes  eleven is in a short walking distance
great location near to beach and sports bar inside
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
location was central
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the secluded area of promtsuk burn was amazing not many on the beach for a peaceful swim
the location of the hotel next to fisherman village you can walk to it
the family vice of the place was really precious and the building itself was a beautiful structure it was very quiet with lovely cricket and frog sounds at night and balls grazing in the front yard so picturesque and the animals who live there are amazing especially mary the cat shell be your best friend the owners are a married italian couple who live downstairs and they are just the sweetest most helpful people ever
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
well kept beach quickly rooms and right on the beach great place to stay restaurant was full of option and nice food
nice beach hotel in one of the best reaches of island good location in terms of quickness and fun beach is excellent to relax and spend romantic time also the street behind the hotel is full of bars restaurant and shops hotels location brings in good balance of relaxation and fun
very nice beach location is perfect
room was good and spacious but the location of the resort can be beat  right on the beach and across the road from central festival shopping mall
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
resort and location fantastic room was huge fantastic value for money
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
not sure why the place is called peace resort if there was everything but peace quite loud plenty of kiss with naples playing in the swimming pool not the very great place for a romantic stay with your partner
comfort close to the beach good location
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good
great relaxing place
great staff good location
it is definitely in an amazing location from beach almost to night life so it has what suits both  lamp is my favorite area in roi same as this was my second time traveling there
we have been travelling for a very long time and no place has felt more like a home away from home than here the food is outstanding the hosts are helpful information and ready to do anything for you the rooms and beds are spacious and comfortable the vs even have netflix if you want to chill reasonably prices alcohol at the bar and a pool table too
amazing place to stay would recommend it to everyone big spacious rooms lovely pool great location just perfect

staff were amazing good location
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
good central location on chewing beach be prepared to walk  minutes to the night entertainment district

this place was great from check in to our departure the breakfast was excellent and our villa was lovely the staff make it particularly pleasant and went out of their way to help me when i was ill
breakfast was very good pool was fine room was a good size view of hillside was what we requested easy to get in and out as wished rented mop and easy parking right in front of hotel nice little pop up bar although did not sit down to enjoy at least somebody did location was good plenty to offer right outside the door buffets down and across street very good go early starts
location was too good and the pool area was awesome
they didn’t make up the room in the second day we call thousands of time to the room service center then they come after an hour and the shower place was broken floor get all wet was really dangerous
come bed and location is quite strategic its valuable distant to to sang beach and many arteries along the stretch of road outside the hotel
the pool and its area could be over crowded in the peak season
nice hotel very clear good pool for relax very good food and nice small pub next to the street with live music only  min walk to to sang beach where you can enjoy a lot of shops and restaurant take there long tail boat to railway beach where is amazing nature or to para sang bear by long tail boat or by walk  nice place can wait to go to oh santa
cleanliness  staff location
great location good breakfast very nice pool and bar i also enjoyed that massage
loved everything about our stay the hotel was in a good location breakfast was great with loads of variety the pool was a good size with plenty of sun beds
i have been coming to this hotel many times as we love the location and the beds but the place needs an update please take care of loose electric sockets restaurant tables with broken corners that hurt my child and other minor upgrade
the location
everything beds were extremely comfortable pool area was great location to beach about min walk had a wonderful oil massage at one of the two spas new and clean hotel for a very good price
the pool area only has sun from around  am until approximately  pm so unfortunately we could not enjoy the sun at the pool in the late afternoon but as long as you are aware of that it is fine to plan to stay at the beach longer 
we had a pool access room which was in the far corner of the hotel this meant that at the start of the day and at the end of the day between clean the water in corner by our room was oily from all the swimmer lotions also the corner meant that our direct pool access area with sun loungers did not receive any sun also we paid extra for the deluge room and they wanted to charge us extra for the slippers
the location and the safety
the hotel was clean staff was helpful and location was superb
location was really good super close to the beach and all restaurant etc front desk staff were nice and helpful at  check in bed was come and room was clean
the hotel is located in a good location a lot of restaurant nearby
swimming pool was great loads of sunbeam great location plenty on restaurant nearby including a wide selection of hall choice hall selection for breakfast and always a slight variety
loved the location staff were lovely pool was fabulous and rooms were nice and fresh and modern and clean only  minute walk to beach if that
nice staff great pool location great
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
great location good choice of breakfast pool bar great familycouples hotel
room is very big and clean location is good lots of restaurant around quiet swimming pool is a bit too cold but not many people and its very nice to have a bar in it
breakfast and the pool location
location and the room was clean
the location is very central to everything you need a min walking distance to the beach seven eleven next door great restaurant opposite quiet location
big swimming pool comfortable bed great location the staff are really enthusiastic
pool area felt like a package holiday no real view from the balcony
location was within walking distance to bars restaurant and beach
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
very nice breakfast i really can recommend this place
good location restaurant nearby and the beach is a short walk away maybe  mind
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area
location is good with a fairly good walking distance to the beach and food outlets
location bazaar from anywhere also be aware that they do not accept any currency except bath
the room had lot of cockroaches all the time they came from everywhere behind the mirror in the bathroom from the air conditioning not very nice to see and they were all hugethe location is ok not much going on outside the resort you have to take a taxi if you want a place more busy with more restaurant and bars
this is thailand small island off mainland gulf between a nice hotel and the people who live in shanty huts across the road is a shock there are problems with infrastructure water senate etc outlets running into reaches leaves you wondering sea defence not finished remind you this is a third world country with sex tourism a major attraction not really the place for children bulges and weak digestive systems the people however are beautiful and cunningly kind
there no lightning in the shower place it’s dark if you take shower in the evening there is no place to hang  to dry the towels
getting run down slightly overpriced the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired  cold coffee no western food to speak of better to go to one of the many other cases in the area
didn spend much time there so can comment on location or that good base to moveabout
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
was a bit of a walk outside the main area of restaurant and nice reaches maybe  minutes walk
mould small bad wifi dreary location
the buildings are starting to look a bit tired in some places the pool villa we had v was looking tired in the bathroom area
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
the bed and pillow were so hard being thrown off the beach at  and at dinner at  with a glass of wine just ordered the false advertising of live music on the beach every wednesday night the unfriendly people who work there the owner who barely says hello never minds asking if everything is good he just sits at a table close by doing his accounts or on his phone having to always check the bill because there was a mistake everytime and then argue about what was on it our last two days we used the place only for sleeping ask for a taxi and they request  bath grab a taxi on the street and pay  bath  yes the place does not cost a lot but you can still smile and say good morning hello or good evening
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom
lots of bugsused two huge bottles of bug spray to have an okay stay in our previous hotel cleaning took care of it sundry service slow and ineffective and location make sure you rent a car or a bike
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way

the location was not as convenient for walking around or for beach access as wed hoped  the free scuttle to the sister hotel at chewing beach was very limited in frequency  we all felt the mistresses were very hard and uncomfortable  it was odd to have the shower in the same room as the toilet
the location is far from everything oh same taxi is very expensive we paid  bath for reach next hotel to hostel taxi
unfortunately its really close to the late night party avenues in so green mange so you will struggle to sleep before am best answer is to keep going until then if there was a way to sound proof this hotel it would be the best accommodation in same in terms of location and comfort
there are rocks inside the water so need to be careful before swim but it is not a problem of hotel just location and also you can pass by about  peters and find awesome entrance to the sea
not the fault of the hotel but sea is not the cleanest in that location found it strange that they allowed cuba diving classes in the pool
sheets not changed for the whole stay of  nights location was quite a way from madam centre  minute walk in c temperatures and  humidity was a bit much best option is to hire a scooterbike from the hotel
the hotel was not as pictured on bookingcom the hotel its self was really run down and forgotten about in my opinion was probably too big to maintain the restaurant area was dirty as were the pools which we never used for that reason it showed beautiful  possibly  infinity pools in photo but in reality one was out of action and the others were to a poor standard the hotel had very few guests and the few that were there didn use facilities either as there were nobody on sun loungers or in pools the grm also pictured on the sight was of poor quality too really old equipment this was one of the reasons i booked this particular hotel a real shame as i thought best western hotel had some kind of reputation to keep on whole disappointing
the location is a little out of town but not a major problem
the hotel rooms are rather old and there are a lot of mosquitoes when you open the door you have to quickly close it buy mosquitoes still come in during house keeping during the day and they are very hard to catch in the room the location is close to fisherman village but that it nothing else there sand on the beach there is very rough sea water quite depressing if i knew the beach and sea are so much worse than ha went i would definitely not stay at this part of the island
outdated dirty dark uncomfortable bed not a nice place every appliance and piece of furniture has not been changed since this place opened bad all round stayed one night and had to leave terrible
the place where i stay no leg to go up so if you travel with handicap or people who are using wellchair very difficult to go up
slight smell in areas but to be expected with old buildings and area
really bad location
i stayed here with my girlfriend we are in our s and the majority of people that stayed here are in the s  dont come here if you are looking to meet other young people location to chewing is about  mind away on a sooner can be a bit of a haste if you are going out most nights
the hotel is linked to the stadium where the boxing takes place every other day so a bit noisy on some days till midnight
bad internet no english to channels except can breakfast every day the same swimming pool to small good location in lamp and on the beach friendly people
fauces at breakfast are in a place where there is no space to put your plate down apparently other guests had complained of the same thing when we mentioned it but the resort manager or owner is not interested to fix it
the hotel needs refurbishment breakfast choice is quite limited took the mind that massage with my husband and completely regretted it requested the massage to be in the comfort of our room but they didn’t allow this other hotels in the area provided this service the massage room was smell and the masseuses was talking to each other most of the time no peace whatsoever our room wasn’t exactly clean there were dirtstain marks all over the bathroom glass door major turn off all in all bad value for money i’ve stayed at apasari hotel are tar and apple a day previously nearby hotels which are way better and cheaper too
hotel is very popular for wedding on the beach and guests are asked not to use the beach when there is a wedding  which i found unreasonable could do with a small selection of water sports facilities like snorkelling equipment maybe some paddle boards some games in the lounge area like cards dominions scramble etcetera would be good
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way
for the price we paid the resort missed the marked it was nice and comfortable but the finer points were missing granted it was off season when we visited so that may be part of the explanation however the experience was pretty average or the amount we paid the location is about  minutes from fisherman village which is beautiful although tourist a major shopping complexarea is just slightly further
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
motion hotel was reasonable rooms were clean and gardens were nice air con worked well  didn try the breakfast but the barrestaurant was nice enough and there is a small pool with some beds should you wish to use it very quiet considering its location
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
the complete stay was perfect calm huge room with everything you need i would definitely recommend this accommodation especially when you looking for a quiet place away from all the party life  bit still you reach the centre of lamp within a few driving minutes  eleven is in a short walking distance
great location near to beach and sports bar inside
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
location was central
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the secluded area of promtsuk burn was amazing not many on the beach for a peaceful swim
the location of the hotel next to fisherman village you can walk to it
the family vice of the place was really precious and the building itself was a beautiful structure it was very quiet with lovely cricket and frog sounds at night and balls grazing in the front yard so picturesque and the animals who live there are amazing especially mary the cat shell be your best friend the owners are a married italian couple who live downstairs and they are just the sweetest most helpful people ever
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
well kept beach quickly rooms and right on the beach great place to stay restaurant was full of option and nice food
nice beach hotel in one of the best reaches of island good location in terms of quickness and fun beach is excellent to relax and spend romantic time also the street behind the hotel is full of bars restaurant and shops hotels location brings in good balance of relaxation and fun
very nice beach location is perfect
room was good and spacious but the location of the resort can be beat  right on the beach and across the road from central festival shopping mall
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
resort and location fantastic room was huge fantastic value for money
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
not sure why the place is called peace resort if there was everything but peace quite loud plenty of kiss with naples playing in the swimming pool not the very great place for a romantic stay with your partner
comfort close to the beach good location
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good
great relaxing place
great staff good location
it is definitely in an amazing location from beach almost to night life so it has what suits both  lamp is my favorite area in roi same as this was my second time traveling there

amazing place to stay would recommend it to everyone big spacious rooms lovely pool great location just perfect

staff were amazing good location
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
good central location on chewing beach be prepared to walk  minutes to the night entertainment district

i loved the fact that this place was so beautifully done and the owner here was quite generous by letting us an early check in
location excellent customer service

location and staff

this place was great from check in to our departure the breakfast was excellent and our villa was lovely the staff make it particularly pleasant and went out of their way to help me when i was ill
breakfast was very good pool was fine room was a good size view of hillside was what we requested easy to get in and out as wished rented mop and easy parking right in front of hotel nice little pop up bar although did not sit down to enjoy at least somebody did location was good plenty to offer right outside the door buffets down and across street very good go early starts
location was too good and the pool area was awesome
they didn’t make up the room in the second day we call thousands of time to the room service center then they come after an hour and the shower place was broken floor get all wet was really dangerous
come bed and location is quite strategic its valuable distant to to sang beach and many arteries along the stretch of road outside the hotel
the pool and its area could be over crowded in the peak season
nice hotel very clear good pool for relax very good food and nice small pub next to the street with live music only  min walk to to sang beach where you can enjoy a lot of shops and restaurant take there long tail boat to railway beach where is amazing nature or to para sang bear by long tail boat or by walk  nice place can wait to go to oh santa
cleanliness  staff location
great location good breakfast very nice pool and bar i also enjoyed that massage
loved everything about our stay the hotel was in a good location breakfast was great with loads of variety the pool was a good size with plenty of sun beds
i have been coming to this hotel many times as we love the location and the beds but the place needs an update please take care of loose electric sockets restaurant tables with broken corners that hurt my child and other minor upgrade
the location
everything beds were extremely comfortable pool area was great location to beach about min walk had a wonderful oil massage at one of the two spas new and clean hotel for a very good price
the pool area only has sun from around  am until approximately  pm so unfortunately we could not enjoy the sun at the pool in the late afternoon but as long as you are aware of that it is fine to plan to stay at the beach longer 
we had a pool access room which was in the far corner of the hotel this meant that at the start of the day and at the end of the day between clean the water in corner by our room was oily from all the swimmer lotions also the corner meant that our direct pool access area with sun loungers did not receive any sun also we paid extra for the deluge room and they wanted to charge us extra for the slippers
the location and the safety
the hotel was clean staff was helpful and location was superb
location was really good super close to the beach and all restaurant etc front desk staff were nice and helpful at  check in bed was come and room was clean
the hotel is located in a good location a lot of restaurant nearby
swimming pool was great loads of sunbeam great location plenty on restaurant nearby including a wide selection of hall choice hall selection for breakfast and always a slight variety
loved the location staff were lovely pool was fabulous and rooms were nice and fresh and modern and clean only  minute walk to beach if that
nice staff great pool location great
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
great location good choice of breakfast pool bar great familycouples hotel
room is very big and clean location is good lots of restaurant around quiet swimming pool is a bit too cold but not many people and its very nice to have a bar in it
breakfast and the pool location
location and the room was clean
the location is very central to everything you need a min walking distance to the beach seven eleven next door great restaurant opposite quiet location
big swimming pool comfortable bed great location the staff are really enthusiastic
pool area felt like a package holiday no real view from the balcony
location was within walking distance to bars restaurant and beach
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
very nice breakfast i really can recommend this place
good location restaurant nearby and the beach is a short walk away maybe  mind
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area
location is good with a fairly good walking distance to the beach and food outlets
location bazaar from anywhere also be aware that they do not accept any currency except bath
the room had lot of cockroaches all the time they came from everywhere behind the mirror in the bathroom from the air conditioning not very nice to see and they were all hugethe location is ok not much going on outside the resort you have to take a taxi if you want a place more busy with more restaurant and bars
this is thailand small island off mainland gulf between a nice hotel and the people who live in shanty huts across the road is a shock there are problems with infrastructure water senate etc outlets running into reaches leaves you wondering sea defence not finished remind you this is a third world country with sex tourism a major attraction not really the place for children bulges and weak digestive systems the people however are beautiful and cunningly kind
there no lightning in the shower place it’s dark if you take shower in the evening there is no place to hang  to dry the towels
getting run down slightly overpriced the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired  cold coffee no western food to speak of better to go to one of the many other cases in the area
didn spend much time there so can comment on location or that good base to moveabout
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
was a bit of a walk outside the main area of restaurant and nice reaches maybe  minutes walk
mould small bad wifi dreary location
the buildings are starting to look a bit tired in some places the pool villa we had v was looking tired in the bathroom area
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
the bed and pillow were so hard being thrown off the beach at  and at dinner at  with a glass of wine just ordered the false advertising of live music on the beach every wednesday night the unfriendly people who work there the owner who barely says hello never minds asking if everything is good he just sits at a table close by doing his accounts or on his phone having to always check the bill because there was a mistake everytime and then argue about what was on it our last two days we used the place only for sleeping ask for a taxi and they request  bath grab a taxi on the street and pay  bath  yes the place does not cost a lot but you can still smile and say good morning hello or good evening
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom
lots of bugsused two huge bottles of bug spray to have an okay stay in our previous hotel cleaning took care of it sundry service slow and ineffective and location make sure you rent a car or a bike
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way

the location was not as convenient for walking around or for beach access as wed hoped  the free scuttle to the sister hotel at chewing beach was very limited in frequency  we all felt the mistresses were very hard and uncomfortable  it was odd to have the shower in the same room as the toilet
the location is far from everything oh same taxi is very expensive we paid  bath for reach next hotel to hostel taxi
unfortunately its really close to the late night party avenues in so green mange so you will struggle to sleep before am best answer is to keep going until then if there was a way to sound proof this hotel it would be the best accommodation in same in terms of location and comfort
there are rocks inside the water so need to be careful before swim but it is not a problem of hotel just location and also you can pass by about  peters and find awesome entrance to the sea
not the fault of the hotel but sea is not the cleanest in that location found it strange that they allowed cuba diving classes in the pool
sheets not changed for the whole stay of  nights location was quite a way from madam centre  minute walk in c temperatures and  humidity was a bit much best option is to hire a scooterbike from the hotel
the hotel was not as pictured on bookingcom the hotel its self was really run down and forgotten about in my opinion was probably too big to maintain the restaurant area was dirty as were the pools which we never used for that reason it showed beautiful  possibly  infinity pools in photo but in reality one was out of action and the others were to a poor standard the hotel had very few guests and the few that were there didn use facilities either as there were nobody on sun loungers or in pools the grm also pictured on the sight was of poor quality too really old equipment this was one of the reasons i booked this particular hotel a real shame as i thought best western hotel had some kind of reputation to keep on whole disappointing
the location is a little out of town but not a major problem
the hotel rooms are rather old and there are a lot of mosquitoes when you open the door you have to quickly close it buy mosquitoes still come in during house keeping during the day and they are very hard to catch in the room the location is close to fisherman village but that it nothing else there sand on the beach there is very rough sea water quite depressing if i knew the beach and sea are so much worse than ha went i would definitely not stay at this part of the island
outdated dirty dark uncomfortable bed not a nice place every appliance and piece of furniture has not been changed since this place opened bad all round stayed one night and had to leave terrible
the place where i stay no leg to go up so if you travel with handicap or people who are using wellchair very difficult to go up
slight smell in areas but to be expected with old buildings and area
really bad location
i stayed here with my girlfriend we are in our s and the majority of people that stayed here are in the s  dont come here if you are looking to meet other young people location to chewing is about  mind away on a sooner can be a bit of a haste if you are going out most nights
the hotel is linked to the stadium where the boxing takes place every other day so a bit noisy on some days till midnight
bad internet no english to channels except can breakfast every day the same swimming pool to small good location in lamp and on the beach friendly people
fauces at breakfast are in a place where there is no space to put your plate down apparently other guests had complained of the same thing when we mentioned it but the resort manager or owner is not interested to fix it
the hotel needs refurbishment breakfast choice is quite limited took the mind that massage with my husband and completely regretted it requested the massage to be in the comfort of our room but they didn’t allow this other hotels in the area provided this service the massage room was smell and the masseuses was talking to each other most of the time no peace whatsoever our room wasn’t exactly clean there were dirtstain marks all over the bathroom glass door major turn off all in all bad value for money i’ve stayed at apasari hotel are tar and apple a day previously nearby hotels which are way better and cheaper too
hotel is very popular for wedding on the beach and guests are asked not to use the beach when there is a wedding  which i found unreasonable could do with a small selection of water sports facilities like snorkelling equipment maybe some paddle boards some games in the lounge area like cards dominions scramble etcetera would be good
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way
for the price we paid the resort missed the marked it was nice and comfortable but the finer points were missing granted it was off season when we visited so that may be part of the explanation however the experience was pretty average or the amount we paid the location is about  minutes from fisherman village which is beautiful although tourist a major shopping complexarea is just slightly further
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
motion hotel was reasonable rooms were clean and gardens were nice air con worked well  didn try the breakfast but the barrestaurant was nice enough and there is a small pool with some beds should you wish to use it very quiet considering its location
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
the complete stay was perfect calm huge room with everything you need i would definitely recommend this accommodation especially when you looking for a quiet place away from all the party life  bit still you reach the centre of lamp within a few driving minutes  eleven is in a short walking distance
great location near to beach and sports bar inside
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
location was central
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the secluded area of promtsuk burn was amazing not many on the beach for a peaceful swim
the location of the hotel next to fisherman village you can walk to it
the family vice of the place was really precious and the building itself was a beautiful structure it was very quiet with lovely cricket and frog sounds at night and balls grazing in the front yard so picturesque and the animals who live there are amazing especially mary the cat shell be your best friend the owners are a married italian couple who live downstairs and they are just the sweetest most helpful people ever
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
well kept beach quickly rooms and right on the beach great place to stay restaurant was full of option and nice food
nice beach hotel in one of the best reaches of island good location in terms of quickness and fun beach is excellent to relax and spend romantic time also the street behind the hotel is full of bars restaurant and shops hotels location brings in good balance of relaxation and fun
very nice beach location is perfect
room was good and spacious but the location of the resort can be beat  right on the beach and across the road from central festival shopping mall
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
resort and location fantastic room was huge fantastic value for money
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
not sure why the place is called peace resort if there was everything but peace quite loud plenty of kiss with naples playing in the swimming pool not the very great place for a romantic stay with your partner
comfort close to the beach good location
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good

like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself

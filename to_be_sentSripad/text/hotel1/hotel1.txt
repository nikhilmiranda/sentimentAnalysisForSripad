toilet is a bit dirty the flow flogged
love the room with pool access  thank u for the romantic dinner arrangement in my balcony
the ensuit could have been cleaner the shower and under the sink water had been sitting not quite what i expectedon second floor maybe we got what we paid for otherwise very good value for money
breakfast was very good pool was fine room was a good size view of hillside was what we requested easy to get in and out as wished rented mop and easy parking right in front of hotel nice little pop up bar although did not sit down to enjoy at least somebody did location was good plenty to offer right outside the door buffets down and across street very good go early starts
restaurant staff asked extra money for offering plates and spoon for the room
location was too good and the pool area was awesome
the bathroom was not clean when i arrived that is not  star standard my room had view to neighbor hotel with very little privacy
great pool walking distance to everything
service en comfortable yacht bed
the breakfast was average the rooms with the pool access do not lead straight into the main pool but rather a smaller pool not worth paying more for it
the staff were friendly and helpful in allowing us to check in an hour early
they didn’t make up the room in the second day we call thousands of time to the room service center then they come after an hour and the shower place was broken floor get all wet was really dangerous
they have an amazing bar near the pool and will have happy hour in the afternoon lovely
water was flooding out of our toilet and hasn been fixes after i asked twice
still a nice hotel after returning in  yearspool and good breakfastlate checkout was possiblestaff is professional speaking english
we reached the hotel around  to pm there a slight hiccup during checking which we were told to wait around mind for the rooms to be ready  maintenance should be carried out frequently and the hotel really need to improve on the housekeeping went out in the morning and came back to the hotel around pm but our rooms were not cleaned despite indicating the make up room sign had to call reception for them to clean the room and it happened throughout our stay
come bed and location is quite strategic its valuable distant to to sang beach and many arteries along the stretch of road outside the hotel
very nice and brand new hotel super clean friendly staff and free parking provided great breakfast we had a pool access room which was amazing
the pool and its area could be over crowded in the peak season
the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day
too many tourist
nice hotel very clear good pool for relax very good food and nice small pub next to the street with live music only  min walk to to sang beach where you can enjoy a lot of shops and restaurant take there long tail boat to railway beach where is amazing nature or to para sang bear by long tail boat or by walk  nice place can wait to go to oh santa
that we were asked to wait on check out for our room to be checked  we had a taxi waiting  and had we used anything from the minimal we hadn they had credit card details to charge to  felt like we were being accused of stealing from the room
nice room
nice swimming poolvery kind and friendly staff
toilet paper very thin no iron for clothes
nothing it was perfect
cleanliness  staff location
very soft bed mattress  i would prefer harder
great location good breakfast very nice pool and bar i also enjoyed that massage
loved everything about our stay the hotel was in a good location breakfast was great with loads of variety the pool was a good size with plenty of sun beds
i have been coming to this hotel many times as we love the location and the beds but the place needs an update please take care of loose electric sockets restaurant tables with broken corners that hurt my child and other minor upgrade
the beds are super come staff are amazing
the clearness was very bad
the location
everything beds were extremely comfortable pool area was great location to beach about min walk had a wonderful oil massage at one of the two spas new and clean hotel for a very good price
hair dwyer
getting a coffee in the morning was terrible due to poor coffee machines moment sound much but it spoils my breakfast
most things about the hotel clean in a great position and the staff were great
nothing all good
all good front office staff excellent
the pool area only has sun from around  am until approximately  pm so unfortunately we could not enjoy the sun at the pool in the late afternoon but as long as you are aware of that it is fine to plan to stay at the beach longer my birthday was on the day of check in and i was a bit disappointed that i did not even get a happy birthday from any of the staff members even though they were standing there with my passport and birth date even when one of my friends said something about it they still did not acknowledge it i don´t care about free stuff but it would have been nice if they would have at least wished me a good day
the hotel looks and feels quite new it is very nice and clean the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff were all very friendly the breakfast is nice and has most of the alternatives you want while the beach is only about a  minute walk away and there are plenty of restaurant  cases  bars in the street right outside the hotel
we had a pool access room which was in the far corner of the hotel this meant that at the start of the day and at the end of the day between clean the water in corner by our room was oily from all the swimmer lotions also the corner meant that our direct pool access area with sun loungers did not receive any sun also we paid extra for the deluge room and they wanted to charge us extra for the slippers
the breakfast was excellent and the pool itself was very nice the swim up bar is a bonus and there seemed to be enough sun beds for everyone the beds in the rooms were also very comfortable
should have more facilities in the room such as iron
the location and the safety
nothing
the hotel was clean staff was helpful and location was superb
face towel looks dirty small swimming pool wifi connection is poorsmall fitness room
the bed is very comfortable staff is very friendly and happy to helps you on any request
i understand that its hard to keep things super clean but the big pool was really dirty it had jets on near the steps were you get in and it was just accumulation all the dead skin and crossness and bubbling around by the jets once i saw it i couldn un see it there was also dirt when entering the big pool which just needed a sweep up but nobody did it also baby pool had what looked like hair stuck all around the drain edge which want pleasant plates from lunch were left out on the side for ages which started to smell as nobody cleared them up
location was really good super close to the beach and all restaurant etc front desk staff were nice and helpful at  check in bed was come and room was clean
we found a dirty towel
the hotel is located in a good location a lot of restaurant nearbythe breakfast was ok and staff was nice too
everything was absolutely perfect staff are very helpfulexcellent breakfastroom and housekeeping service very responsive and clean beds are comfortable good shower wifi works well value for money
phone calls after  to go downstairs for checkout although give paid extra to stay till pm wifi was not feeling well and the calls woke her up sorry but it was a little bit annoying considering that give paid it  mind before the first call
nicely located friendly and helpful staff good value for money upgrade our room free of charge because of our honeymoon
loved everything
swimming pool was great loads of sunbeam great location plenty on restaurant nearby including a wide selection of hall choice hall selection for breakfast and always a slight variety
the price of breakfast but  drinks get one free what happened to buy one get one free especially if your solo
loved the location staff were lovely pool was fabulous and rooms were nice and fresh and modern and clean only  minute walk to beach if that
nothing highly recommended
it was in the heart of all the street markets loads to do see hotel is very modern clean beautiful pool bar great atmosphere with the sun you actually can’t get better i’ll be back next year no complaints
nice staff great pool location great
friendly staff great location right in the centre of to sang only a walk to the beach to catch the boats to railway beach there was a small safe pool for children which was amazing as we could sit and watch them while they played safely beds were comfortable and out request for a cot was met we also ate at the property at night where we would sit outside and watch the singer at the bar across from the restaurant but still on site and the food was excellent excellent would stay again
it was really a bad hotel not like the pictures firstly the swimming pool is not clean very dirty and smells like toilet the rooms are too old doors are not closing air condition was working loudly that we cannot sleep the sea was so poor i  booked  min message but they only do for  min and not a good one it was total a disaster all guests and workers are so rude they always shout at swimming pool housekeeping shouts doors so wakes you up in the morning so do not think to stay at this look quality hotel
the room is a little out dated bide was very strong and tap in the sink doesn flow out properly
cosy
leaving
great location good choice of breakfast pool bar great familycouples hotel
view from room facing another hotel which is not great for privacy we called reception in an evening to bring up two wine glasses and they refused to do it and asked us to go down to the bar and pick it up by ourselves
room is very big and clean location is good lots of restaurant around quiet swimming pool is a bit too cold but not many people and its very nice to have a bar in it
breakfast and the pool location
location and the room was clean
service has gone done in the past  months bad mixed at check in that should never have been allowed to happen at a  star hotel poor cleaning and restoring of rooms not enough staff to handle the customers no iron or iron board available very disappointed as our first stay was great but this time it was not living up to our previous experience of the hotel not sure we will want to book this hotel again
the location is very central to everything you need a min walking distance to the beach seven eleven next door great restaurant opposite quiet location
a little bit slowly while cleaning the room
big swimming pool comfortable bed great location the staff are really enthusiastic
delay in providing rooms
very courteous smiling  tried to accommodate our odd requirements
pool area felt like a package holiday no real view from the balcony
location was within walking distance to bars restaurant and beach
room directly opened up to another hotel not the best view
spacious rooms modern design accommodation staff
no air conditioning in lobby or always and was  degrees
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
bit noisy and crowded
spacious clean room comfortable bed good breakfast
see check
skin sugar
central lägenära shopping n m
very nice breakfast i really can recommend this place
more option for breakfast would better
clean big room nice staff
air conditioning was pretty loud
comfortable clean room  good location restaurant nearby and the beach is a short walk away maybe  mind
room didn’t get cleaned until late afternoon most days
super come bed very clean great pool
good locationsfriendly staffquietrich breakfastlive music in front of the hotel
everything lovely hotel and i will be staying there again next visit
can’t think of anything everything was fine
having visited to sang a number of times many of the properties are known to feel a little bit versed or even outdated was pleasantly surprised to find it recently built and in good condition i rate it as a nice medium to high range hotel type can’t think of anything to fault it was comfortable clean and within short distance from everything beach just min down the road with all the long tail boats and agencies to organize any of the island hoping breakfast had a nice variety with all the usual stuff faces at the pool bar were really mummy and not too crazy ‘hotel prices’ overall yeah i’d stay again
the internet is really slow and takes ages to work sometimes often the sheets were dirty when they had just been put on also wish there was a bit of a better atmosphere round the pool such as some music or something
the hotel was very modern and the room was very spacious it is also just over a  minute walk to the beach which is great staff were also amazing with everything
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area
location is good with a fairly good walking distance to the beach and food outlets
everything was perfect
the bar fridge did not worked to get a bucket and ice every night
the pool was a bit cold for us and the breakfast was not to our taste but there was a variety of choice so everybody can find something
resort feels tired probably  years past its best rooms not particularly well  cleaned towels and linen a little ruby wifi not great breakfast dull guests are politely forced to leave loungers and bean bags at any time from    to make room for evening dining tables on the beach  which during our stay at least were hardly used booked a standard room which was horrible  dark and just not comfortable  the door and window fitting had huge gaps allowing many mosquitoes into the room each night asked if i could pay for a better room for the remainder of stay and was told nothing was available so looked on bookingcom and saw that  superior rooms seemed to be free for the duration of stay when i showed the staff they eventually agreed a change of room it shouldn have been that difficult oh and booked and paid for a transfer from the airport on arrival which didn show up  an admit error on the hotels partner great after  hours of traveling and didn really feel the apology was adequate i guess it was a last minute budget option  but reinforced for me that its worth paying a bit more for real comfort and quality
the only point which was a bit disappointing to us was the price level for food and drinks compared to the prices outside the hotel we understand that they have to be a bit more expensive to cover for all other costs the hotel incur but the level was a bit too high under these circumstances and in that surrounding it basically matched german prices with some items even exceeding them
location bazaar from anywhere also be aware that they do not accept any currency except bath
the restaurant was empty most of the time and less service and friendly there
only can say that the prices are a little on the high side for thailand however food is amazing but could do with more offers and promotions and better happy hours
no complaints we really enjoyed our stay
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
the renovation going on right next to our room it felt a bit overpriced in that sense when we were considering staying longer they wanted to charge us more then before instead of going down in price because of the renovation
needs a bit of maintenance outside but didn bother us
bit noisy and crowded
the room had lot of cockroaches all the time they came from everywhere behind the mirror in the bathroom from the air conditioning not very nice to see and they were all hugethe location is ok not much going on outside the resort you have to take a taxi if you want a place more busy with more restaurant and bars
this is thailand small island off mainland gulf between a nice hotel and the people who live in shanty huts across the road is a shock there are problems with infrastructure water senate etc outlets running into reaches leaves you wondering sea defence not finished remind you this is a third world country with sex tourism a major attraction not really the place for children bulges and weak digestive systems the people however are beautiful and cunningly kind
rooms were small and cramped
though it is really on the beach the hotel is  not located in the best part either of the beach the water was not very clear or of chewing a little far from the centre
noisy rude staff dirty uncomfortable
there no lightning in the shower place it’s dark if you take shower in the evening there is no place to hang  to dry the towels
a cooked breakfast would have been lovely
the first room we had smelled like old bed sheets after  hours in a bus we just wanted to relax tired as we were we found out that the to doesn work at all so we went to the owner and asked for new bed sheets  a little ashamed of it because it sounds so pick  and told her that the to was broken she checked both immediately came back and told us that we are having new sheets now the other ones were clean she said but they are washing with cold water so they have still some spots on it our advice to the hotel buy new ones even the pillows itself are smelling like old oily heads we felt very uncomfortable the owner told us that the to wouldn work the smartbox was broken we read about the hotel at booking and about the access to netflix as i said after a bad night in the bursae told us she would give us a new smartbox later when someone else checked out around  clock at around  pm we asked for it but she told us it doesn work and its just for one night because the other day we would check out we are traveling since four months through south east asia and this was one of the most insolent comments after a few months of traveling you are happy about a to on the other side i think there is no need to justify its not their business we paid for it we wanted it so we asked for a discount she just smiled and said no and the smartbox isn included at bookingcom i told her that the regular to doesn work either and that it is included but no she just wanted to ask the other owner later it was frustration after this i finally wanted to take a shower my girlfriend went first but she was running out of water in the end there was nothing left for me now i got angry and went downstairs again and told the owner about it she apologized and said she would call someone the tank was empty i asked for another room and she said yes if you prefer
everything was just fine except there want a beach to sit on you had to walk m along nearer the restaurant
shower was inside the bath which was very tall  it made climbing in and out very dangerous  bathroom could do with a complete update
didn find the front office staff very helpful or friendly everything seemed an issue for them
the breakfast was everyday the same the bathroom was smelling weird from the pipes
the mattress was broken we suffered two nights but staff not change it only turned it over to the other side it was more better but not enough good for sleeping
getting run down slightly overpriced the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired  cold coffee no western food to speak of better to go to one of the many other cases in the area
wifi poor
no proper beach to swim in  the so called free massage were done with clothes on at one point when asked for a  bottle of wine to take back to the room there was no stock when i complained to the manager he said he placed an order for  bottles  they were coming in  weeks  he said he’d get me one “outside” for a very “good” price this is supposed to be a  star hotel  and there were bull ants in the condiments staff in reception didn’t seem to know a lot about their surroundings to give the tourist any into no entertainment especially at night or activities hotel stuck out away from everything at least  mind to half hour scuttle to anything
old design old fashion design ugly pool design villas very close next to another the same with sun beds and these beds in white were so old that looks grey n black i didn touch them  really disgusting staff knowledge of english on basic level  not nicer then average not saying hello when passing you breakfast rather less than average for me overpriced but its oh same  in general renovation needed with a good interior designer
bed wasn’t the best as it was two singles pushed together and the pillows were hard not much of a view from the balcony on ground floor
the beach wasn’t as beautiful as others i’ve been lucky enough to stay on in oh same
didn spend much time there so can comment on location or that good base to moveabout
some ants around the room
really hard beds
the garden view is a view to a construction site
one of the staff by the pool could have helped us carry our luggage which we dragged up from the beach having just come off a boat
as far as i remember genius peaks include welcoming drinks however i did not get one
does that have anything to do with having separate and backtoback reservations
construction going on in back of facilities
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi
was a bit of a walk outside the main area of restaurant and nice reaches maybe  minutes walk
bed was bit hard
mould small bad wifi dreary location
breakfast is bad
in the middle of no where with absolutely nothing in valuable distance if you want any snacks essentials etc you either have to buy it from the hotel or rely on a hired bike or taxi to go to the shops
nothing really maybe the air con needing a clean out smelled a bit
looks a bit run down in daylight but at night it looks really nice
because they are not directly on the beach there are no chairs for the resort on the beach
wifi is working only hobby but fast
nothing ，everything is good
very noisy during the renovation and if it was main season the pool would have been very small for all guests
wifi connection was poor and breakfast as well
the wifi was very difficult to connect to maybe because i was in a room at the back of the resort also when i asked for assistance getting the wifi to work the member of staff told me he would come to my room but never did since wifi was the least of my worries i didn pursue the issue any further and spent most of my time exploring the island
the morning i left the property there was no running water in my bathroom
the only other little problem was the construction work going on right outside my room during the day time it was very noisy and on one occasion after a little too much sun i wanted to take a nap but found it very difficult with all the banging and drilling going on outside i want warned about this construction work prior to my visit or on arrival and it would have been nice to have been told and given an apology in advance
wifi polish and front beach stoneyshelley
would have liked warm bacon at breakfast other than that great selection of food
just that the pool bar close to early
because of where the fan is in the capsuleroom people can see into your capsule therefore felt slightly paranoid when getting changed etcrequested an airport pick up a few days prior to arriving and no one showed had to ring hostel and waited  minutes in total but still charged the full amount for airport pick uneven though the privacy is great in the capsule rooms it made it very difficult meeting other travellers if your travelling solo this may not be the best hostel for this reason
to much noise
very small to be honest  the room felt cramped and also the so called one way glass is quite see through in the right light even during the day
also found a rather large cockroaches in the shower which caused my girl friend to be running around screaming naked for about  minutes
the rent for kitchenequipment was way to high  th or day we had the honeymoon villa and could feel a little alone when it want any neighbours but no problem at all
i have reserved an ocean view villa and i pay more but i get partial ocean view villa and no one get me my money back and once you spoke to them they make them self stupid its all thailand like this they concern for your money and once you pay no one will take care of you
org the first room was horrible the bed was full of bed bags so we went and change rooms and then the other bed sheets where dirty as well asked them the next day to change the sheets and they didntso i ask them the last day to do it and they finally ideally not worth the money to stay there
the buildings are starting to look a bit tired in some places the pool villa we had v was looking tired in the bathroom area
our room was quite warm the first two days like the air conditioned wasn’t working  also inconsistency w the towels  bath towels every day but hand towels only twice and washcloths only once
the rooms reminded were very basic and our bath had a leak in it
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
nothing that i recall to be honest
the bed and pillow were so hard being thrown off the beach at  and at dinner at  with a glass of wine just ordered the false advertising of live music on the beach every wednesday night the unfriendly people who work there the owner who barely says hello never minds asking if everything is good he just sits at a table close by doing his accounts or on his phone having to always check the bill because there was a mistake everytime and then argue about what was on it our last two days we used the place only for sleeping ask for a taxi and they request  bath grab a taxi on the street and pay  bath  yes the place does not cost a lot but you can still smile and say good morning hello or good evening
one staff member was really impolite there a lot of noise turning the night if there any sport event going on in the world
on the first floor under the wooden walk way the pretty pond under it needed the water changing as a little stagnant
a little cramped
on the first floor under the wooden walk way the pretty pond under it needed the water changing as a little stagnant
sea prices are high
the air conditioned in the room was not so good because the air remained wet
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land
nothing not to like
my only drawback was the curtains in the room as they do poor blocking of day light and night lights so for those like me who prefer dark atmosphere to sleep you find difficulties doing that
one air conditioning did not work and was not fixed during our  days time despite asking to fix it
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom
less mosquitoes
as we was in low season there was nothing much around if you dont have sooner or car
right in the flight path of the airport about  km away  unless you like the sound of an aureus seemingly about to land in your bungalow as your wake up call at am
also the rooms have no ventilator are super hot and you can hear everything in the rooms next to you
no elevator
nothing really but my only suggestion would be would a pool bar maybe
terrible service in front desk as if they were offended all time
us  buffets without water but need to buy wimmimb pool without water but need to buy
dirty cup during breakfast
 min for a sandwich in international restaurant for dinner when not busy at all as we are the only guest
bed are rock hard and with a large panel to the side so for older people or less mobile hard to get in and out
the bar closed at
wifi in my room want very good
old facilities
grand villa is literally just a room that was a huge shock and letdown
the rooms were a bit dated and dark
it was on a busy road with no shops and its trickydangerous  to get a taxi
there was some wear to the property but nothing to discourage you having a good time i stayed on lower floor but other rooms on walk up second and third floors
loud music by guests next door and late night parties am  hotel should be more vigilant about asking guests to respect the quiet hours policy and definitely not allow loud music by anyone at daytime  we actually went to both rooms and asked the guests to turn the music down and take their am ratio conversation inside they repeated the next night as well  just rude guests not the hotels fault
resort needs renovation
beach villa was great but out of date
beds were uncomfortable far too hard
too many mosquitoes no effective measures
lots of bugsused two huge bottles of bug spray to have an okay stay in our previous hotel cleaning took care of it sundry service slow and ineffective and location make sure you rent a car or a bike
the beds are very hard
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way
sea looked not very clean nobody was swimming in the sea water temperature  everybody was using the fantastic pool
room and bathroom facilities need some renovation
no dedicated hosthostess in dining room at breakfast so some people wandered around looking for an empty table while others stood at door looking lost
bigger problem was a few guests drinking from glass bottles in the swimming pool if one broke the entire pool would have to be emptied to ensure every last piece of glass was removed i did bring this to the attention of reception who thanked me but did nothing
shower was hard to regulate
having to leave
the beach was quite dirty
nothing to dislike
the cocktail
mosquitoes everywhere
smell of dampmold in room
bathroom shower out dated and toilet not working properly
no to or wifi for  days
no hot water in the sink
mosquitoes
more than  minutes walk to the lamp center not nice if going by the road quite nice via the beach
other than not discovering there was a somewhat secluded lift until day  when we were on level  everything was great
a little bit prices but worth it
understanding pricking for that hotel is somewhat difficult because of strange yield management  for the same stay one can check rates on different dates and through different channels and get  price difference
while it is clear sensimar is working on minimizing its footprints eg straw made from plants a little more could be done eg more began option on menu less single use bathroom products remove elephant breaking from tour option etc
the bed was on movement all the time
toilet not good
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars
the location was not as convenient for walking around or for beach access as wed hoped  the free scuttle to the sister hotel at chewing beach was very limited in frequency  we all felt the mistresses were very hard and uncomfortable  it was odd to have the shower in the same room as the toilet
should be more that food on the menu not interested in italian food in thailand
poor quality and limited variety at breakfast tap water was running in yellow color
even the we asked for a quiet room it was right next to the street when they could have have given us a room further away from the traffic noise the the breakfast should have been included in that room price
the breakfast was everyday the same the bathroom was smelling weird from the pipes
bed are rock hard and with a large panel to the side so for older people or less mobile hard to get in and out
the rooms have seen better days but are still okay our superior room was big the iron broke twice but was fixed the same day our telephone want working as well but got replaced the same day as well the breakfast at the hotel is really expensive
cold shower upon our second stay
the sea is not so great at this part of the island rocks in the water at the entrance though a perfect beach everywhere
noisy full of mosquitoes no hot water only cash payment forgot my taxi arrangement to the airport
a bit prices but worth the prices of the sea and the bar at the pool where too much for us
beach thin peace of sand
the near free reaches were dirty and full of garage but it is a common problem across asia the hotel is a bit far from the island nighttime anyway readable by scuttle bus but this is not necessarily a bad thing
the location is far from everything oh same taxi is very expensive we paid  bath for reach next hotel to hostel taxi
unfortunately its really close to the late night party avenues in so green mange so you will struggle to sleep before am best answer is to keep going until then if there was a way to sound proof this hotel it would be the best accommodation in same in terms of location and comfort
should do more to combat insects in the rooms shower pressure was a bit weak
rooms could use a bit of a refresh or update
breakfast beach was not very good
stronger tea in tea pot
balcony doors are very secured from outside but can be tricky i locked myself outside on the balcony at the second floorwith no other way than shout to get some help
absolutely nothing
the rooms weren so clean and also the bathroom was a little bit too dirty when i arrived
poor response to maintenance calls re room jacuzzi
this is a resort in the hills there not much to seed within walking distance the hotel provided a scuttle bus to their sister hotel in the busy beach free of charge also the plugs were just a bit far from the bedside
the beach was a bit rocky and its limited in food choice
i didn like the premier room bathroom how its semi open i got attacked by mosquitoes every night
‚beach house‘ under renovation
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it
the room is small
it is not the resorts mistake but the road that separates the villa from the resort pool breakfast is really noisy and if you are a silenceseeker do not go there
no umbrella to provide shade at the pool
everything looks a little bit old  not dirty but old
the water in the sea is a little dirty
mistresses on sunbeam umbrella at the swimming pool need dating there dirty and torn
in the first day the water flow was poor they fixed it the day after
breakfast was a little bland plenty of places to eat nearby
ontbijt berg basic
pillow is not comfortable
a few things at breakfast bar not replaced readily
there are rocks inside the water so need to be careful before swim but it is not a problem of hotel just location and also you can pass by about  peters and find awesome entrance to the sea
we moved rooms on arrival as the offered room looked a little tired however this was dealt with quickly and efficiently and we were very happy with the end results
not the fault of the hotel but sea is not the cleanest in that location found it strange that they allowed cuba diving classes in the pool
sea prices are high
poor service staff poorly trained and inexperienced offer little more than the standard answers no converge service
nothing at all its fantastic
we found a wizard in the room the first night and we changed the room then the other room had no hot water and it was a two beds put together instead of a one bed as requested which was not comfortable also the anti mosquito curtain which supposed to cover the  beds was not made for one bed but two separate beds
instead of upbraiding or changing the room someone repaired the shower and they added another mattress on the two beds which was not so come a bit a shame for the price we paid
we stayed over another island and came back to anantara for another  nights and the room was bit far from the beach
big cockroaches that we spotted while having dinner
and last but not least bookingcom charged me more than the price advertised
had a villa room with plunge pool not as good as they used to be  bathroom very substandard brings this room down in comfort considerably some sort of much like oilgrease on the beach no warning to guests from the hotel management    unable to swim in sea at chewing  sent email to management asking for partial refund offered an upgrade next time plus explained what the actual much is and how they dont know when it will be on beach as subject to the sea currents  now placing notices for guests when the currents bring the much to the beach
fitness centre not maintained including equipment and anna was costly red  bath per min and the breakfast was very basic and poor considering this was a star resort with little choice of various foods
well it could have been an all inclusive sea like the name said
they need to get better wifi and offer it all around the resort not just public areas it doesn’t make calling back home easy
i liked every minute
low variety of breakfast
book a room with iron weather can get really hot
sheets not changed for the whole stay of  nights location was quite a way from madam centre  minute walk in c temperatures and  humidity was a bit much best option is to hire a scooterbike from the hotel
if you wanted any privacy showering or changing you had to close the blinds as the room was overlooked by the outside staircase leading to all the rooms in the next building
the owner a russian guy i think working reception in the evening came across as bored and grumpywhen i asked if he could change a bath note i needed a couple of bath notes for local shop he obliged with a  and  and was definitely not happy about doing that
the hotel was not as pictured on bookingcom the hotel its self was really run down and forgotten about in my opinion was probably too big to maintain the restaurant area was dirty as were the pools which we never used for that reason it showed beautiful  possibly  infinity pools in photo but in reality one was out of action and the others were to a poor standard the hotel had very few guests and the few that were there didn use facilities either as there were nobody on sun loungers or in pools the grm also pictured on the sight was of poor quality too really old equipment this was one of the reasons i booked this particular hotel a real shame as i thought best western hotel had some kind of reputation to keep on whole disappointing
first room smelt of beverage upgrade room lacked clean door final room better however ac collapsed expelling ice
the location is a little out of town but not a major problem
no sun lounge or umbrella on the beach
pillows are terrible and beds quite hard so didn’t have the best sleepspillows at least could easily be fixed
smoking being allowed around pool know it’s asia and their smoking laws aren’t the same as as but it’s very offputting having it allowed in public areas not only where nonsmokers are trying to relax but also children playing
hotel could have a better environmental policy were there for  nights and all of our towels were changed daily even when we hung them this is a bit excessiveespecially when we were happy to refuse for a few timesthis coupled with the lax pool towel rules no limit to how many you can takeleave per daytowels left everywhere can’t be good for washing and water consumption
lack of glassdishesrubbish collection around the garden poolstaff weren’t very attentive in this aspectthings were left for quite some time without collectionsometimes not at all there was an empty vodka bottle left collected by the pool for days
these are more minor issues or suggestions for improvementthings we noticed and didn’t like but certainly didn’t adverse affect our stay
la liveried
the hotel rooms are rather old and there are a lot of mosquitoes when you open the door you have to quickly close it buy mosquitoes still come in during house keeping during the day and they are very hard to catch in the room the location is close to fisherman village but that it nothing else there sand on the beach there is very rough sea water quite depressing if i knew the beach and sea are so much worse than ha went i would definitely not stay at this part of the island
outdated dirty dark uncomfortable bed not a nice place every appliance and piece of furniture has not been changed since this place opened bad all round stayed one night and had to leave terrible
paper thin walls so if you have noisy neighbours they will be waking you up at all hours of the night
internet is weak resort needs some paint
we were asked for a deposit it per night of stay after i have fully paid the room at the check in this did not make any sense and really ruined the first impression we were told the deposit is needed for the damage we would cause it is a hotel for mass tourism it was not worth the price we paid
the hotel provides slippers in the room but they are not new and not properly cleaned judging by their smell
breakfast was a disappointment  quality of food is not up to the price level low quality oil make any omelet incredible cheapest white bread etc breakfast room did not have enough space and efficient staff created even more chaos no self service for tea or coffee  that creates a long waiting time sometimes we had to ask  times staff do not speak and do not fully understand english so it makes it a bit complicated
the sea was very dirty due to rainy stormy weather stray dogs running at the beach and overall  very sad to see so much rubbish
cleanliness of the private plunge pool food was overpriced
the internet service very slow
the place where i stay no leg to go up so if you travel with handicap or people who are using wellchair very difficult to go up
be careful of being over charged for everything
slight smell in areas but to be expected with old buildings and area
don’t really have
there could have been access to some staff at night
the bed and the amount of money that is charged for everything including water
the renovation going on right next to our room it felt a bit overpriced in that sense when we were considering staying longer they wanted to charge us more then before instead of going down in price because of the renovation
we had no hot water on our first night from pm due to internal works on their water system and we weren’t informed when we checked in we found out by a note that was left on our bed no staff had told us of this which was disappointing the water was supposed to be back on from pm the cold water worked after this time however still after pm we had no hot water and the cold water from the sink was spitting out a yellow colour we were changed to a different room that night after complaining to the converge they did however give us two free cocktail voucher also disappointed breakfast was not served until after am which isn’t ideal if you have an early morning flight and have paid for the buffets breakfast  we asked for a coffee around am and was told staff wouldn’t make one until after am we expected more from a  star resort
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better
really bad location
you can hear the airplane passing by in the morning and the noise from the guy next door request for enjoining rooms  one of the jets of the jacuzzi tub fell off but was not fixed by the next day  the water pressure of the shower was really weak so we had to take longer to clean ourselves
rooms bit dated towels need all changed past sell by date by a number of years
just a heads up that the resort sits on a hill and some parts are a steep walk especially tough in humid weather fortunately they have golf carts to transport you and your luggage
i stayed here with my girlfriend we are in our s and the majority of people that stayed here are in the s  dont come here if you are looking to meet other young people location to chewing is about  mind away on a sooner can be a bit of a haste if you are going out most nights
the bandage resort and sea was starting to show its age accommodation is getting ready for a return and modernisation probably a more family orientated resort
the sea is too shallow so was not possible to swim but the pool is very good
we didn like that the toilets in the room are just separated with a curtain from the balcony no door or wall only curtain
if you want a lot of liveliness you will be able to find it within  minutes drive
we were given a villa that was noisy had no internet and was filled with mosquitoes
this is a resort in the hills there not much to seed within walking distance the hotel provided a scuttle bus to their sister hotel in the busy beach free of charge also the plugs were just a bit far from the bedside
the hotel backs onto a nightclub that plays loud music until am
absolutely nothing at all to dislike
no hot water in my bungalow which i knew before i arrived
mosquitoes please take care of it they were a big pain outside or inside the room staff behavior could have been more inviting than present and lastly the cocktail were devoid of alcohol all the drinks were a complete cheat
there was no in room safe although safety deposit boxes were available at the reception which you had to buy a lock for  in assuming they have learnt from mistakes with the room safes
i liked everything about this propertythe only slight negative is that the beach does have lots of shellspebbles and old coral if you wade bit deeper so you will need water shoes i want fussed about this though kiss will have fun though with the variety of beautiful shells
a shame breakfast was not included the shower in the bathroom could have been stronger
more equipment in the grm would be good also the beach out the front is somewhat rocky so not first choice for a swimming beach but picturesque nonetheless
rubbish on the beach
the biggest downside of oh same is the transport taxidrivers tuktuk drivers and anyone else exploit tourist by charging a fortune for transportation it was as ridiculous as for every km travelled the cost would go up by  bath not even their version of user was very costeffective tourist have no choice but to fork out their money as walking on the roads in oh same is hazardous and the chances of being in an accident are high  so dont
this resort is situated on a hill so be sure to tell your driver that he needs to take you to the top of the hill otherwise they will leave you at the bottom and trust me when i say its not a hill you want to climb especially after a day out
coming home
the hotel is linked to the stadium where the boxing takes place every other day so a bit noisy on some days till midnight
bad internet no english to channels except can breakfast every day the same swimming pool to small good location in lamp and on the beach friendly people
excursions proposed by the hotel were a little on the expensive side would recommend organizing directly with the service provides
bathroom need some work no hot water one toilet had no toilet seat toilet paper dispense in the worst position possible that was really the only let down
was mislead about family room near pool had to pay to upgrade up a very very steep hill food was very poor sister hotel food was outstanding
the wifi at the pool is a little weak could be improved works fine anywhere else
coffee at breakfast is not the best and you get charged if you want to upgrade to an express or a late
the room door and windows not close so well so you can hear noise from outside but this problem its not a big problem for me my big problem is if someone sit and smoke in front of the room the smoke smell come through the hole between door and windows so it smell  bad like they smoke inside your room
shower need attention the temperature in different rooms kept varying
fauces at breakfast are in a place where there is no space to put your plate down apparently other guests had complained of the same thing when we mentioned it but the resort manager or owner is not interested to fix it
some pool chair cushions are quite worn for a  star hotel wooden dealing is starting to look feathered and could use a coat of varnish
when we checked in only  girl on the desk and it took us about  minutes to check in
very close to the port so maybe the sea not very clean
not pleasant to walk around
for the less able bodied the amount of stairs to get to some of the rooms may be an issue
the hotel needs refurbishment breakfast choice is quite limited took the mind that massage with my husband and completely regretted it requested the massage to be in the comfort of our room but they didn’t allow this other hotels in the area provided this service the massage room was smell and the masseuses was talking to each other most of the time no peace whatsoever our room wasn’t exactly clean there were dirtstain marks all over the bathroom glass door major turn off all in all bad value for money i’ve stayed at apasari hotel are tar and apple a day previously nearby hotels which are way better and cheaper too
no mosquito nets in the room
the bed was quite hard i didn find it very comfortable to sleep on
pay extra for getting cappucino coffee at breakfast
hotel is very popular for wedding on the beach and guests are asked not to use the beach when there is a wedding  which i found unreasonable could do with a small selection of water sports facilities like snorkelling equipment maybe some paddle boards some games in the lounge area like cards dominions scramble etcetera would be good
not clean
songthaews in lamp beach scar people but it has nothing to do with the hotel
breakfast has less choice and its the same everyday
it needs refurbishmentlong overduelots of the hotel is tired and jadedtvs are from the s and have  working  channelsthe bathroom is somewhat unmanageable as a wet room the shower is simply the noble above beside the toilet and the whirlpool bath want worth the risk it looked it may have carried the plague every shower therefore rendered the entire floor wash all the way up to the washbasin and mirrorthe loungers on the beach are frankly requiring to be burned as firewoodthe double bed waswere two singles pushed together
the tap in the bathroom was broken and it leaned water on the floor but they repaired it immediately
needed some maintenance in the rooms starting to look a little tired couldn get  keys for the room
it raised quite badly whilst we were there and the villa leaned water in so badly that we had to mop up the water as it was heading towards our belongings and the bed there was also water leaking through the ceiling as the roof times had blown off we called the hotel reception two times to be told they would send someone down to us but no one came they were only gathered about what colour towels we were using to mop up the water my partner had to go to reception in the end and get someone down they weren’t that gathered about what had happened and explained we should have put the blind down that was outside on the balcony unfortunately this was never explained to us when we arrived plus if we had been out for the day we wouldn’t have put the blind down expecting it it rain the manager basically made out like it was our fault not what you expect when you pay over £ pounds per night i would have expected some sort of good will gesture but we got nothing
the rooms are very small  m but the quality is very good great shower beds and breakfast is very nice  we had connecting doors between the rooms with our kiss
the wifi in my room was a little predictable but the connection was fine in the lobbyrestaurantreception
staff were pleasant and friendly but completely unresponsiveforgetful with any requests  for example we needed toilet paper called the front desk  hours later still no toilet paper
when we moved on to our next destination we left something behind at kirikayan  it took many phone calls to establish that they had the items even though we were not asking them to send them to us  we just needed a yes or no but this was extremely difficult to get
the pool is lovely and peaceful with a jungle backdrop  peaceful until they inexplicable start playing dance music which varies from relatively mellow to completely irritating  completely destroys the absence and is loud enough that you can hear it on all the balconies overlooking the pool
breakfast is great but main menu could be better beef with my carry was too chew i understand we are on a tropical island
breakfast was very average
be cautious real rooms in this boutique hotel do not match the photo on the bookingcom for example we booked superior villa bungalow suite  there are two large bright rooms with panorama windows to the sea at the photo but the hotel has only one such room in the remaining nine bungalows rooms are small dark with only one window to the pool most likely you will get such room like we got
there were other minor faults eg never changed the linen during  nights but they have no value compared to the awful photo cheating
rooms were very old sheet were torn driver from airport had issues
there were a lot of families and kiss around when we went we are in our early twenties so at times it felt a little much however this is not the fault of the hotel by anymeans it’s perfect for families maybe not so much for those of the younger generation
staff never smiled rooms appalling dirty and no privacy
no personal suffer
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way
the air con in the room down stair was not excellent we were room  perfect room otherwise
get a   story room as air conditioning on ground floors takes in musty smells
only fault would be that a massive centipede was found in our bathroom during our stay stuffed helped immediately but this was our only unpleasant experience
breakfast in the resort is not the best i would exclude this from future booking and go elsewhere for breakfast
there is a very very busy road just behind the resort
the only draw back was the fact that there was a large number of step up to the room however there are bulges to drive you to your room if required
for the price we paid the resort missed the marked it was nice and comfortable but the finer points were missing granted it was off season when we visited so that may be part of the explanation however the experience was pretty average or the amount we paid the location is about  minutes from fisherman village which is beautiful although tourist a major shopping complexarea is just slightly further
a little expensive for the evening meal but quality of food was good
bit of a drag into the town but we wanted to just chill so it was fine for us
the shower and air con want bill but it worked we hoped
there were ants and a wizard in the room the wifi was not consistent in the room the phone number on the bookingcom webster was different from the phone number listed on goose and when i remained the property for the hotel confirmation and airport transportation i did not receive a response
the penza could be better and the pool in the villa could be more cleaner
foreign staff want as friendly as that staff not very accommodation
the room was a long walk from reception since i have a health condition i would have liked to know that heading in
the beautiful layout it was fantastic
very basic lodging was fine to sleep in
nice pool good price
the friendly atmosphere and staff being right by the beach good wifi and very helpful staff
privacy because of the capsule bedsstaff is friendly
locationthe enclose to the cityvariety of restaurant
excellent experience hotel and staff where brilliant
excellent location right in the centre and near the beach lovely pools as well staff very friendly and helpful
the staff where always smiling and keen to help anyway they could
motion hotel was reasonable rooms were clean and gardens were nice air con worked well  didn try the breakfast but the barrestaurant was nice enough and there is a small pool with some beds should you wish to use it very quiet considering its location
very nice staff nice see view great sea great breakfast also for began beautiful garden around hotel walking distance to restaurant and shops
far location only a  minute walk to the beach close to lots of local restaurant and only a short taxi ride away from the main strip for clubs and a night out the staff were so helpful couldn recommend any more
friendly staff good location and nice and clean
i like the long low no noise peaceful
excellent resort quiet while in the middle of the town awesome and helpful tears breakfast very good as well
wonderful and helpful staff copy atmosphere
lovely staff really helpful
great restaurant
good value
lovely staff and option of staying on the street side in more great value bungalows or in the more luxurious rooms on the beach side  great location need the ferry and airport for convenience  max
not too far from everything very comfortable bed nice big room
every thing the staff were brilliant food and drink fantastic and the resort beautiful
the complete stay was perfect calm huge room with everything you need i would definitely recommend this accommodation especially when you looking for a quiet place away from all the party life  bit still you reach the centre of lamp within a few driving minutes  eleven is in a short walking distance
room cleaned daily and good to
great location near to beach and sports bar inside
friendly staff and very efficient they check your room for anything you may have left behind upon checkout great facilities the grm was useful and sea but expensive the food was good but nothing to write home about the pool area and bar is great and perfect for relaxing
beds and pillows were super come
too stairs
location was central
staff was super friendly balcony was really nice to have short distance to the beach and  really close by all in all a good place to stay at oh same
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
the secluded area of promtsuk burn was amazing not many on the beach for a peaceful swim
the location of the hotel next to fisherman village you can walk to it
the beach is the best in bout
the room is very comfortable
the staff is really nice
it is very peaceful
the family vice of the place was really precious and the building itself was a beautiful structure it was very quiet with lovely cricket and frog sounds at night and balls grazing in the front yard so picturesque and the animals who live there are amazing especially mary the cat shell be your best friend the owners are a married italian couple who live downstairs and they are just the sweetest most helpful people ever
beach location and staff
great value good location friendly staff nice pool especially beautiful view and relaxing at sunset
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
we traveled as a group of  people had a nice and spacious clean triple room which was located to the side street top floor the owner hotel manager and staff were very friendly and attentive gave us many good recommendations and offered us nice trips for really good price we really enjoyed our stay and can recommend it to other travelers
thank you same beach residence
friendly and helpful staff always happy to organise transfers and booking breakfast was also worth adding to the booking
extremely friendly and accommodation staff good proximity to fisherman village lovely room
the bed was hard but we asked for a copper at reception which made the bed more comfortable
the customer relations manager was very nice and extremely helpful
the room and bathroom were both very spacious  the bed was a good size but the mattress probably needs rotating
the pool is big and you can generally get a seat around the pool but if not the beach has plenty
the hotel service is excellent   the crew at the bar and restaurant all do a great job looking after you 
my hint would be when you check in they will ask you if you want to take out a loyalty card with them  it can be a benefit so its worth considering but you have no idea to what value as they dont give you any cost information  my advice would be to tell then you want to think about it and then head to the pool bar to check out the menu and prices  then work out what you think you might typically spend in a day and calculate what the total spend might be for your stay   you can then go back to reception and take out the card that works for you
the room was clean and the bed was really come
breakfast was good villa was clean beach front villa ratio is awesome bed is very firm
well kept beach quickly rooms and right on the beach great place to stay restaurant was full of option and nice food
service was exceptional
very good localisation
nice beach hotel in one of the best reaches of island good location in terms of quickness and fun beach is excellent to relax and spend romantic time also the street behind the hotel is full of bars restaurant and shops hotels location brings in good balance of relaxation and fun
there was by night on the beach with live music fire dance and good food highly recommend to anyone it was a great fun and hats of to band which were to best among all other option in oh same
rooms were large beds comfortable  do not accept room  near reception noisy and basically no privacy  staff were accommodation when we requested room change  always request upstairs rooms for privacy  we had deluge terrace not worth the additional money  superior rooms more than adequate our friends had one  we only sighted one standalone cottage and again would not pay the extra for this room
very nice beach location is perfect
fried omelet croissant freshly made fresh fruit
room was good and spacious but the location of the resort can be beat  right on the beach and across the road from central festival shopping mall
everything excellent
good parking and nice clean room
there was a really good vice about this place maybe it because they dont allow any children that its just that little bit more relaxed and chilled great rooms great pool and pool bar good breakfast and proper coffee nice friendly and helpful staff at check in too
the location and the view from the room was spectacular the bed was comfortable and room was spacious the staff were kind and we the breakfast time was until pm which was very convenient
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
be warned the resort is in the flight path so planes fly over and are quite loud once you get used to them  you dont really notice it
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
staff was extremely courteous
resort and location fantastic room was huge fantastic value for money
free breakfast was a per great location and  pools  on beach  staff was very friendly and accommodation great place to party as they have a do at one of the pools massage and hair braiding on site beautiful beach close walk ball shops and restaurant
staff were all very accommodation and helpful overall i did enjoy my stay here i just think your room needs serious improvement to meet expectations
my third time to thailand as well as my third stay at ark bar i can get enough of this hotel met alone this island i think to same is my favorite place in the whole work ark bar is the place to be during the day they have it all pool do everyday at pm three excellent restaurant amazing staff serves and bartenders if you aren’t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost  bath for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day i must say that this is for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from pm until about am then this place is perfect for you wednesday and friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesday and friday at the pool they have a free buffets at  as long as you purchase a drink i can say enough good things about this place and i will definitely be back
everything specially the view
great massage on the beach
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
nice big form rooms air con works wells
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
every things
the pool on the roof location was decent good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
great room great pool and bar friendly staff
not sure why the place is called peace resort if there was everything but peace quite loud plenty of kiss with naples playing in the swimming pool not the very great place for a romantic stay with your partner
couldn fault the hotel lovely spacious rooms it is a long walk to centre of the town but very close to beach
comfort close to the beach good location
pool and the beach
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
room was clean and it was good value for money very basic but i want expected more
the staff are some of the best i have encountered you seldom find this level of customer service outside of a  star  nothing is too much trouble  the pool area and restaurant are super and even the studio rooms are very good
great relaxing place
the view and beach was awesome
great staff good location

nice breakfast nice view nice garden
it is definitely in an amazing location from beach almost to night life so it has what suits both  lamp is my favorite area in roi same as this was my second time traveling there

amazing place to stay would recommend it to everyone big spacious rooms lovely pool great location just perfect

staff were amazing good location
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
good central location on chewing beach be prepared to walk  minutes to the night entertainment district
the pool  breakfast is very nice fruit that food eggs in different variant vegetables and and and location quite good  mind walk to chewing beach
the breakfast was very good and free the beach was nice and quite and we could swim to our hearts content

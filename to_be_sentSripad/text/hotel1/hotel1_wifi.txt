wifi poor
mould small bad wifi dreary location
wifi is working only hobby but fast
wifi connection was poor and breakfast as well
the wifi was very difficult to connect to maybe because i was in a room at the back of the resort also when i asked for assistance getting the wifi to work the member of staff told me he would come to my room but never did since wifi was the least of my worries i didn pursue the issue any further and spent most of my time exploring the island

they need to get better wifi and offer it all around the resort not just public areas it doesn’t make calling back home easy
internet is weak resort needs some paint
the internet service very slow
we were given a villa that was noisy had no internet and was filled with mosquitoes
bad internet no english to channels except can breakfast every day the same swimming pool to small good location in lamp and on the beach friendly people
the wifi at the pool is a little weak could be improved works fine anywhere else
the wifi in my room was a little predictable but the connection was fine in the lobbyrestaurantreception
there were ants and a wizard in the room the wifi was not consistent in the room the phone number on the bookingcom webster was different from the phone number listed on goose and when i remained the property for the hotel confirmation and airport transportation i did not receive a response
the friendly atmosphere and staff being right by the beach good wifi and very helpful staff
staff were very accommodation amenities in the room were what id of expected from  or  star hotels wifi was fast location is good contrary to what i read in other reviews  minute walk is sufficient to get to where everything is going on place was pretty much fruitless
for wifi i didn used a hotel wifi so didn knew a wifi quality
beach nearby with area fenced off by singer net many restaurant in the neighbourhood
great staff very kind and helpful good value for the money good wifi conductivity

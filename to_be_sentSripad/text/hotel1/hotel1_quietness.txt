the hotel is well situated only  peters from the beach shopping and eating possibilities are on the footstep the room is spacious well equipped and cleaned every day there is coffee tea and  later water per person every day free of charge the pool is nice and big enough  it is also looked really clean well maintained the breakfast was good we could eat different food every morning the staff is helpful and kind we had ac problems twice but they repaired in a couple of minutes other then that the ac worked like a charm we could cool yourself down every day
room is very big and clean location is good lots of restaurant around quiet swimming pool is a bit too cold but not many people and its very nice to have a bar in it
the location is very central to everything you need a min walking distance to the beach seven eleven next door great restaurant opposite quiet location
was a cool hotel in good location staff was nice too
loud music by guests next door and late night parties am  hotel should be more vigilant about asking guests to respect the quiet hours policy and definitely not allow loud music by anyone at daytime  we actually went to both rooms and asked the guests to turn the music down and take their am ratio conversation inside they repeated the next night as well  just rude guests not the hotels fault
even the we asked for a quiet room it was right next to the street when they could have have given us a room further away from the traffic noise the the breakfast should have been included in that room price
motion hotel was reasonable rooms were clean and gardens were nice air con worked well  didn try the breakfast but the barrestaurant was nice enough and there is a small pool with some beds should you wish to use it very quiet considering its location
excellent resort quiet while in the middle of the town awesome and helpful tears breakfast very good as well
the complete stay was perfect calm huge room with everything you need i would definitely recommend this accommodation especially when you looking for a quiet place away from all the party life  bit still you reach the centre of lamp within a few driving minutes  eleven is in a short walking distance
the family vice of the place was really precious and the building itself was a beautiful structure it was very quiet with lovely cricket and frog sounds at night and balls grazing in the front yard so picturesque and the animals who live there are amazing especially mary the cat shell be your best friend the owners are a married italian couple who live downstairs and they are just the sweetest most helpful people ever
the hotel was just want i was looking for as a place  to relax for a few days i while away the days on the sun beds  pads in the sun or shade the staff were so attentive and friendly the room was great come bed amazing shower and ll the amenities you expect its right at the end of lamp beach so its really quiet  this was the perfect place for me
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
very nice resort  smaller than it looks in the photo but that is a plus nice pools come rooms and quiet location
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
comfort of the villaroom garden of the hotel smile of the team the pool area and view breakfast quiet place
easy spot to get to beach some good food vendor outside room very comfortable and quiet owner helpful for us getting around oh same
very friendly frenchspeaking hosts quiet garden across the road from the beach close to a couple of ferry option waterfalls golf courses and music beach club  small jacuzzi pool is nice in the evening
what a far hostel very modern and comfortable great staff and facilities super cool side with large communal areas to meet people
its quiet peaceful and on the beach
staff were really helpful good location in lamp across from night market  decent pools with lots of sun loungers we booked for  days and stayed an extra  lamp was very quiet during our stay but not expensive to get share taxi to chewing for night out
beautiful quiet location right on the beach excellent for a couples holiday
it was quiet and peaceful with beautiful surrounds
excellent resort to relax stunning views and quiet poolbeach  rooms were spacious and clean
everything was great super rooms great food and drinks very friendly and helpful staff beach facilities was the best and the hotel was in perfect distance from town in a quiet relaxed area easy to get in to chewing with a taxi we will be back
the hotel is amazing the room we stayed was fabulous with a great view of the ocean the beach is great very calm with few people the restaurant in the hotel is very good many good option and great price you can rent a motorcycle in the hotel which can be a good a way to go around the island
great location very quiet place a great place to relax and unkind

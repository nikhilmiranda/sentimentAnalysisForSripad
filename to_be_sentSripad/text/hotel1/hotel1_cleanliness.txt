fried omelet croissant freshly made fresh fruit
good parking and nice clean room
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
we booked this resort for some beach time expecting to have rooms on the beachside of the road when we arrived we were informed that our rooms were across the road and although we could use the facilities on the beach side we would be staying the other side of the main road the layout  set up of this resort could be explained better so guests are more aware of what they are booking having said that our accommodation was very comfortable and good value for money the kiss loved the pool and it actually didn make an difference that we were across the road from the beach in the end i would recommend this place as the staff were lovely and the rooms were clean and comfortable we did not have iron but had a fan  the room was a bit stuffy but that is to be expected  the fan worked well though
fantastic place very clean and large room the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was to die for remember to try the pool bar happy hour
we spent  nights in same garden home and we actually liked the place we had standard bungalow and it was clean and spacious we made breakfast ourselves so we appreciated that there was kitchen with everything you need for cooking including normal size fridge the bed was comfortable area is quiet as its    km outside of lamp beach centre staff was really nice and welcoming would return there again
room was clean and it was good value for money very basic but i want expected more
excellent food very friendly and helpful staff super nice and clean bungalow deluge pool very convenient with restaurant beach and pool so its easy with kiss
the location the clean and beautiful beach the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms
everything very nice staff clean perfect for what you pay close to the beach restaurant pharmacies convenience stores etc
like the hotel its called the scent the first moment you step in it feels zen because of all the scent a quiet place to stay with a clean private beach the staff is warm polite and always with a big smile loved the a la carte breakfast menu instead of a buffets it feels like all the dishes are made with love every evening there will be a little surprise waiting for you at your room really nice gesture go experience and found out yourself
beds were super come  pool area clean and pleasant  location best of both worlds as easy walk to bars restaurant etc but not on your footstep interrupting sleep

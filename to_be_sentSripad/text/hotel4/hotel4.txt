really bad costume service we had  rooms and couldn’t get even one for early check in despite the fact that all the rooms were ready but they kept us waiting till pm as its their check in time and even after that took them  min to give us our rooms i ask them couple of times if we could get least one of our rooms  hour early as my wife was pregnant and she wanted to rest but they refused and said we all had to wait till pm which is not expected from a star resort and when we got to our rooms it was really hot and the air con was off the checking out time is really early at am and dont expect to get a late check out in room dining service is till pm which is a really weak point for the hotel as the nearest place to get something is  min drive or min walk
hillside pool suites are really nice and absolutely worth the extra money
the beach isn wonderful so i would not stay there for longer that a night or two unless you are not a beach person another strange thing about resorts in same is that there agent any ranges passion fruit or other exotic fruits included there i really missed that
the villas are amazing the breakfast is awesome and included even the transport from your villa to the restaurant is complementary we really enjoyed the property and the villa of course
definitely not  star i think just a  stari booked the sea view pool villa but it barely had a sea view due to buildings in the wayalso we found a spider and cockroaches in the bathroom
staffs were friendly and nice  breakfast quite a lot of option
the beach full of rocks u can’t swim you have to walk to the next hotel to swim also the room service should be  h
the atmosphere and the hotel the sea
very very bad stuff not friendly very far rooms you should walk to the reception after breakfast to take a car to go your room when i want to order water in breakfast they told me go to and bring your water
the swimming pool have a very nice view the sea was normal but good view
not great value
hilly site  beachfront terrible  door and saying very old  maintenance and upgrade needed around grounds and gardens very overpriced
they could have introduced more variety in the breakfast menu across the week
staff were very helpful at all times they always went out of their way to assist us with all of our needs
the staff was very pleasant and also the food was were taste
rubbish on the beach
fancy rooms breakfast is luxurious pool and beach are great big beds the room can fit  instead of  as mentioned
garage in beach and the bad in breakfast not freschthe van timetable and availability to short take  in consideration the distance to city centertáxi services with  higher prices comparing with our quotation
the sea view staff very kindness clearness global except room glasses
location noise of airplane
friendly service great breakfast comfortable room
i didn’t like the insects every where my opinion is to remove all the trees and grass because who will com to hotel doesn’t need thatand all people com’s for beach not to stay close to the trees and grass etc
location
nothing could’ve been better everything was exceptional
i loved absolutely everything about the hotel and it’s surroundings my partner and i were on a  week holiday to thailand and this was our favourite hotel out of all of the places we stayed which were all  and  star hotels too
buggy cart
they had two wedding during our stay for which they informed us on the day as opposed to before our stay our room was bit far from the wedding functions but we could hear the noise
the breakfast was really really good generally the atmosphere at the hotel was superb the staff were very helpful and friendly the room was super big and considering what we paid i really enjoyed the facilities were beyond expectations including the pool and food we came here for our honeymoon and would recommend this for couples
i booked the villa with private pool very nice accommodation with a beautiful view one little point of critic the room seemed slightly outdated we felt like we where in paradise but we also paid for it
the only draw back was the fact that there was a large number of step up to the room however there are bulges to drive you to your room if required
we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall
i understand previous reviews about the beach not being great which was why i chose a hillside pool room and glad i did room service food was awful restaurant food was good so maybe we just got room service on a bad night town’s a little far away can’t walk there but tut tut’s and cabs are very easy to get right outside the hotel everything at the resort was super expensive so worth the trip to town for meals drinks massage etc that being said we still had an amazing time on our honeymoon in our villa if we came back to oh same we would stay further down the island with the nice sandy reaches closer to town but if you’re looking for some romantic seclusion nor burn was great
we had a hillside pool room and it was beautiful the resort was easy to get around with the carts the pool bar was also beautiful the wifi was great the food was great the photo are totally accurate of the hillside pool villa it really was the most spectacular view and a beautiful place to spend the first week of our honeymoon
the beach was stone
breakfast was amazing
lack of english language by staff too many tourist come all staff she be speaking in  resort  need a life guard at the pools and stop kiss from jumping
the rooms were far and the whole scene experience
check in early n checkout late was nightmare staff has high attitude on above topics
the iron in the bedroom noise was a bit louder than what we are used t
staff very helpful and going the extra mile
the view of the beach is spoiled by electricity posts and wires
the service and facilities
customer service from the reception desk was not in keeping with the rest of the hotel
beautiful hotel and free scuttle bus to the centreclose to the airport
view from the room was very bad
amazing breakfast great swimming pool
the hotel was especially hilly you have to be strong and healthy to walk up and down the hill to get to your room the beach was very rocky no one goes there the restaurant is ok but food was way too expensive they dont have too many choice for you we also couldn find any stores or places to eat around the hotel we ended up renting a car
the room was clean and big breakfast was good
a lot of rooms were too far from the breakfast area and the walk back to the  room was very firing the golf car service was only available from the reception and not from the breakfast area the climb is too firing
the architectural and artistic theme was good pleasant feel to the place
servicestaff
breakfast
view and garden
i paid for a villa with private swimming pool which was very nice the room was hot the air con is weak and that the situations in all their villas to pay so much money and not sleep well is a waste of money and vacation time pillows are cheap no down pillows food in the hotel is way overpriced especially in the restaurant and quality is very low do yourself a favor and go eat outside amazing fresh food and much cheaper
the swimming pool is very nice with amazing view staff in the reception was trying to charge me more money for a taxi then actual cost its a big shame that hotel staff are thinking how to screw their guests
staff
okay experience  staff not very courteous
poor beach no facilities  bad beach restaurant
nice breakfast nice view nice garden
nothing really unlikable nighttime a little quiet
the hotel was generally very nice layout of the location was compact but comfortable
nothing
nice hotel
close to the airport
met and exceeded my expectations i will be returning
location is good valuable to the main attraction of conan
cut little huts good area and so close to the beach
the resort was very pretty it was lovely being able to sit by the beach with a drink despite the fact it is in the middle of chewing with all the nighttime the resort itself is very quiet the breakfast was amazing
super cheap and a great location the room got a little hot at times and the facilities were basic but we knew this at the time of booking and is why the price is so good a great little stop off for a budget stay
more or less private beach nice quiet location clean tidy nice gardens and pool
everything was perfect the view from the room come bed nice swimming pool  min walk from the main road
the place is fantastic comfort living and nice environment
great location near the beach but off of the main road so not noisy during the night modern and clean rooms
the cleaning lady was very attentive and very pleasant as were the all the breakfast staff the front desk staff were very cheerful and helpful
we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant on the last night and it was delicious the pool was very nice and clean and the staff were wonderful
the character of the hotel is fabulous the staff warm professional and friendly the food great and the situation the prime location on the chewing mon beachfronti would have rate the hotel  based on my very first impression but i have to say it grew on me splash of cash at least  years overdue
been here so many times its hard to say what i like but everything
beautiful rooms set back in nature lovely pool staff and service greatly enjoyed our penthouse suite with amazing views perfect for a romantic gateway staff was so friendly and helpful we will be back again soon
absolutely great staff even when we came back from another island and needed them to book us a taxi and we needed a quick swim they were available and we were no longer checked in says clot  really great place and great location
gardens and beach
the location right on the beach
was excited to come back for my second year and for that new year and songkran unfortunately it was not the same as last year it was so dead the little outside canada was ruined and unstable the pool was constantly full of bags there is no outside drinks allowed and with it being new year we wanted a little while to chill and hangout before the water fights and the only drinks available where changes and breeze and they were very over prices but it does state they have bucket but unfortunately while we were there the want any actually available with it being so quite i hoped to get a sooner for rent and they didn have any left the girl at the front said so we had to go to the same pier to rent one i went with my fiance and didn stop talking about the place until we got there as i was so excited because of my wonderful stay last year we got two single beds instead of a queen or king so we had to push our beds together i will say the staff is still amazing the beds and pillows comfortable
staff always smile and friendly
nice hotel very generally located in busy chewing although you are in the middle of chewing you dont notice that at all its very quite  the fact that you are central is comfortable if you are with kiss and dont want to rentdrive a sooner but do want to go out at nighttime beach and pool are great very large always beds available with a beachbar that has nice fresh fruit cocktail european pricesstaff are very friendly and helpful overall good experience and would certainly visit again
the room was lovely and the view from the balcony i was in the sunrise jacuzzi room was amazing the staff were all very helpful and friendly and the location is great  on the quieter end of chewing beach but still close to the action
we just stayed one night the hostel is good it is small and familiar but the way to the restaurant and the beach is hard and really dark surging night time
the location of the hotel was lovely all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially the lady at reception the food was good and i liked the fact they had a different promotion every evening overall i will highly recommend to anyone going to visit oh same
peaceful location  staff were very friendly  room was huge  minimal was reasonably prices  nice pool  sea massage was really good
quiet yet next to fisherman village service staff venue beach and pool all great
we had a room with a pool now stunning little hotel beach and main pool are far strawberry daiquiri cocktail are out of this world
proximity to beach very quiet
this is our second time here we enjoyed absolutely everything the private beach is just a dream very clean sand and water not many people service is on high level and restraints are very good quality and prices are realistic resort’s staff is very friendly some of them are working for many years here was glad to see them beautiful nature around very good to have evening promenades the rooms are very clean and comfortable i really liked the idea of using bamboo straw for all drinks myself and my husband initially divided our trip into two hotels as we were staying in same for  days so after tongs bay we went to intercontinental hotel but we were disappointed by their beach and dirty neighborhood and next day returned back to our favorite tongs bay
we recommend this place for those who really want to have very quite and private holidays with high quality service and enjoy private beach
transport was readily available breakfast was lovely staff were very very friendly and helpful  was really nice of the manager to show us around cleaning staff bar and restaurant staff and even staff at reception always greeted us with a smilebrilliant facilities pictures probably don’t do this place justice it’s really beautiful the rooms are emasculate

lovely resort the swimming pool has an amazing view and our room with outdoor bath was lovely and spacious we read in the reviews the road was very steep and we thought it might be a bit of an exaggeration but it really is steep the views up the hill are stunning though we met a couple who were staying at the executive suite in room  and they had the most breath taking view from their balcony so the view depends a bit on which room you have
we were only there a couple of nights but if we were there for longer we would have rented a motorbike one place down the road rents from  bath a day and that would have solved the hill issue at the same time if you are looking for a romantic and relaxed gateway and prefer a more secluded location this resort is perfect
amazing place so beautiful and quiet exactly what we wanted stay here
amazing stay i stayed for  nights and can hardly find a fault with weimar the resort is stylish and tranquil with a fabulous pool with a swim up bar and happy hour everyday to enjoy all the delicious cocktail they have to offer the food in the restaurant was great  we particularly enjoyed the saturday night by where we had amazing speak and pawns while listening to a very talented live musician one of the highlight of our stay the clientele is mostly young couples giving the place a very calm and relaxed vice we didn’t try any of the activities offered but there would be lots to do for anyone looking for a more active stay especially for those interested in exercise and you overall a wonderful stay and one of the best hotels i have visited
good location close to the beach bars and shops
staff is fantastic ask for a special dinner at the beach magnificent experience
restaurant nearby
minutes away from viberant chewing beach clubparty life
quiet resort with lots of green and direct to a quiet part of the beach
the property was great value for money we got our room upgrade for free and the staff were so accommodation
it is a heavenly spot fine arrangement excellent pool we go to this hotel annually service and personnel this time has especially surprised numbers are washed to gloss cleaning daily water paper towels  everything is bungalows process means from insects  there are no ants even thanks to managers of hotel and to personnel for the fact that so watch hotel
idyllic we wished we had booked to stay longer a hop skin and a jump from the beach an absolutely stunning location food was excellent the service was amazing staff were wonderful and resort extremely clean
very good comfort very clean and well arranged resort great beach and pool nice bungalows
the porters and room service staff were really good and helpful always willing to help out with a smile on their face
very friendly staff
good position
huge rooms clean good price excellent pool excellent view photo on bookingcom dont do it justice restaurant is nice and they do room service at no extra cost water every day for the fridge along with room cleaned kettle in room free tea no coffee big flat screen to plenty of sockets nice porch to sit on to eat staff are really nice best place we stayed in in all of se asia
breakfast buffets was very good with a big choice and waiter service for the main course which meant that you receive warm eggs self service for extra like fresh fruit toast etc oh why can  hotels in thailand get faster masters nut the customer service lady  i think was exceptional she seemed to make a point of scurrying around at breakfast greeting guests and making sure they were happy and she always remembered my name my room was on the first floor and was well appointed and very comfortable beach at the hotel was well kept and clean plenty of sunbeam and a nice beach side bar good hotel with very good and pleasant staff and far enough away from chewing nighttime and noise to be able to get a good nights sleep
the staff are friendly they offered us free dinner to  apologize for ants in the room very good location
the staff
comfortable and clean well maintained rooms as well as pool at hotel and access to beach front pool in sister hotel along beach
nothing good i really dont like it need to change every thing in room because its look so old
but the staff is good
the hotel is a quite place for those who want a more relaxing environment
loved the location  it is right at the end of fisherman village a true little boutique resort  our included breakfast was perfect every morning  everything was clean and the maid cleaned our room so quickly
convenience
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
excellent location peaceful loved our bungalow very clean staff were very attentive
very nice bungalow with kitchen
wonderful breakfast area with open view of the sea the iron was good and we could set it to be cool without getting cold we got a place on the private beach every day and it didn’t feel crowded a really pleasant beach
great location close to the beach
everything
super clean and comfortable and a great breakfast buffets at the sister hotel across the road also great because you can use their facilities like the swimming pool and grm etc overall we had a great stay here
good location near the beach and shops family mary  pharmacy  restaurant massage parlour rent bike  souvenir shop room was okay old type bed is very big  can fit  adults   kiss beach n hotel surrounding is clean we are lucky that we able to check in at pm town centre is only km away to find hall restaurant u need to take have transportation motorcycles is the best choice cause u need to explore the place to find it  i love the morning joy by the beach
we had the suite on beach very comfortable room and view is amazing the owner has just put in machine that converts humidity into water will be once you know how to work it need instructions
overpriced nothing much and this is a strictly a cash business so dont think about paying your balance with your isa card  i had to walk to the cash machine and the staff graciously let me check in and pay the balance later i mean come one they say we only take isa and when i show them my isa card they pull that passive  aggressive that stuff ah ohhhi i i sorry i dont speak english  the room was poker and it had stairs so if you are traveling with young children you may consider this  the room was just ok far from town poker concrete and nothing special  the pool was small and the staff ok after i paid them in cash  there are two eating spots close by which are fair and tiny store which haswater  ok enough in glad i escaped
very good location great staff so so helpful manger is very helpful speaks good english so easy to talk to
staff was courteous practice and emphatic the food in buffets was fresh and appealing there were also more option provided in the hot and cold beverages compare to the other hotels the room was spacious and had all the amenities and moreover it was kept really clean and tidy for a lawless stay the sooty facility was available with the hotel  hence there was absolutely no need to submit your passport to the outside vendor overall complete value for money
excellent location friendly and helpful staff have just been enjoying my stay there
friendly staff nice little pool on chewing beach but slightly north and away from the busy beach
location was good most staff friendly king size bed
great location loved the privacy and bungalows were a great size and very comfortable beach area was clean and the resort pool was lovely would definitely come back
pool and view
had a great holiday here
good location right on the beach and close to bars and restaurant friendly staff
the rooms are great for family sharing location as well is good and check out was pretty pretty good
this hotel is my absolute favourite the view of the beach is amazing it’s not too busy so you can enjoy the beach and hotel facilities without any haste the rooms are cleaned twice a day morning and evening with thoughtful added things like lighting a candle in the evening or leaving a fruit basket as a welcome ‘present’ the service is the best i received in thailand all members of staff are smile positive chatty and so welcoming they are always there to help you even before you realise you need help 🙂 absolutely impressed and would definitely go back
beautiful cabin with view of the sea and palm trees  very quiet and peaceful and very helpful staff good food
amazing woman in the reception extremely helpful with everything from giving us recommendations to helping us get a free transport to the pier do not miss the restaurant called brown sugar next to the entrance or the sunday market
the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were nice and clean
excellent place cheap and close to everything in boat pier and airport  it was so good we stayed  night at the start and came back to the hotel for our final night to fly home the next day
the location
bed and pillows were really comfortable terrace with poolview was also pretty beautiful science in our room privacy and very nice atmosphere in whole resort rich breakfast with nice poolview and very nice and helpful smiling staff
not a lot to say as everything was perfect  brilliant staff beautiful rooms  perfect location if your looking for your piece of paradise then look no further
the staff are really helpful and friendly the french lady at the reception helped us make our trip great the property is located in a quite side of oh same however food was never a problem as there are many good beach side restaurant around the property  definitely i will recommend this place to a friend
the staff were very friendly and the hotel was situated in a nice place close to beach and shops
clean and friendly atmosphere
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
overall we liked the hotel it is new and modern room and bathroom was really big were got the pool view room with a nice terrace which was nice the best part of the hotel is the pool area  i have never seen such a huge pool grm is well equipped as well
lovely private pool beautiful location serenity  huge come bed
we had a lovely time at the resort and would definitely come back again the breakfast buffets is incredible interest of variety and taste it‘s also only a short walk to the fisherman‘s village which has some nice bars and restaurant
it was everything we were looking for and then some we stayed in anantara lawn in the first week of august in the deluge double room with pool access
from our arrival at the reception where we were greeted by the lovely staff with such warmth and care till they day we left the experience was unforgettable throughout our stay it felt like being at home away from home
the room was the perfect size and the bed was extremely comfortable to the point that half the time i didn want to get out the bathroom had an amazing tub which we used daily to soak away our tiredness and the open air shower with its own garden patch was an added cherry on top
we had our own private ratio with direct access to the amazing pool which was always clean and had the perfect height and length i took a swim  times a day and still couldn get enough
breakfast was lavish served at the restaurant overlooking the beach the beach was clean and calm and the resort offered free kayaks cases life jackets for the guests
the anantara lawn is ideally located with a short taxi ride to the downtown area taxes are available at all times there is a little convenient store just opposite which was extremely handy for midnight craving the resort arranged a car for us and that made seeing the entire island very easy oh they offered maggie services for guests to move around the resort that was ideal for the lazy person i am
the sea was heaven and a must try
overall out of our time in bangkok before same and pocket after the highlight of our entire vacation was the anantara lawn i highly recommend it even though it may seem prices but it is worth every last penny we can wait to go again
the staff were fantastic so helpful and kind i had everything i could need and more upgrade on arrival wonderful food a tailor on site to make a gorgeous dress in his pool and gardens are maintained all the time and trip around island was fun
everything
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
beautiful hotel and grounds free  minute welcome massage at the sea friendly helpful staff breakfast box was prepared for me when i had to leave early and missed the buffets shutters available for free to and from town lots of fun things to do cool reef to snorted in in the bay
the staff were lovely
the property was amazing  we received a free upgrade from a poolside to a villa poolside apartment which was very spacious  the location was very quiet and enabled us a spectacular view to the sea the food was great fresh fruit cake or biscuits were freely provided daily the staff were awesome entertainment provided both day and night so you didn’t need to go venture out we felt well pampered on our last day we enjoyed a couples full body massage it was our first time having this that treatment a super end to our holiday  we will definitely be visiting again

wonderful luxury villas with private pools very friendly polite and helpful staff very much enjoyed our stay
large comfortable rooms well equipped grm nice pool walking distance to the beach good food
the hotel was just amazing such a beautiful place and right on the beach
a wonderfully relaxed break at this boutique hotel  staff were excellent and perhaps what makes this such a great place to stay  ideally located
the food was absolutely delicious and of very high quality english speaking staff gorgeous beach private to hotel residents and the water was calm enough to go swimming even during the month of august excellent facilities and activities on site there is so much to do and we didn feel the need to go elsewhere we loved the private gardens cycling and visiting the animal farm property and villas are so romantic hands down one of the best properties i have been to so far with my partner and worth every penny
amazing open air breakfast with pool and beach view fresh juices prepared instantly for you that and europeanwestern choice ice cream corner for little kiss nice setting high chairs for the little ones
beautiful adults pool
rooms are surrounded by a nice garden and have open air bathroom with a huge bath tube
the beach where the hotel is located is one of the best of the island plenty of nice restaurant on the beach but quiet and not too crowded
i wish i would have booked a different hotel the staff were really great and had amazing massage ladies at the resort on the beach the beach itself was very nice and loved how you could get food and drinks delivered to you on they beach the price of the food and drinks were cheap and tasted amazing
great hospitality excellent location

fantastic hostel we stayed in the private  bedroom room with shared bathroom the rooms were clean and had air conditioning very happy with the staff and facilities at the hostel  value for money
travelled with family during this month and we booked deluge room at first we were greeted by very courteous staff and well informed in our room after the checking timothy room is very clean and spacious unlike what other people write on the reviews saying its dirty cleaning is done everyday including changing of bedsheets and pillow sheets rooms service can be ordered until  pm and breakfast everyday was surprisingly enough and lots of variation its delirious specially my favorite wattle can also order vegetarian food just need to inform the staffs were entertained by dandy who very attentive in our needs service with a smile as always since we are vegetarian dandy helped us in every way he never gets tired whatever we need as well as to other guest once called by his name well known for his being so friendly as i guests encountered some ac problem but it was solved immediately after being told to fix and they are very apologetic the fact it occurs one takeover all our holiday was perfect and the best  since bring staffs and management are all very helpful to make our family holiday the way we wanted we even got a free transfer to airport arranged by dandy thank you to mr thaippine days boss as he always said😊👍 thank you the bring management and we will definitely comeback with our friend as we already advertised it to all of our friends in indian must visited than other hotel which is expensive worth the value as i can say missing the place now and had a lovely memory with dandy from philippines for being so hospitable and taking care of us specially my   yes old daughter misha
the pool overseen the sea and the direct access to the beach it was possible to borrow towels from the hotel for the pool and the renting a motorbike was easy and cheap

nice looking resort
the location

amazing boutique hotel with a very suppurative and friendly staff perfect to relax and enjoy the island

good value for money and lovely personnel
location was good
staff was nicegreat location although a little bit noisy at night can blame the hotel for this its nor their faultroom was clean bed very comfortable and bathroom was nice

very well maintained helpful staff and a relaxing pool
everything is excellent staff are super friendly and helpful highly recommend will come back next time
fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the location was incredible  the value for the location is a steal  the food was a good price and the service was great and the food was average but very good for the price
the staff were fantastic the rooms and all facilities were very clean spacious and the resort was small so it never felt busy the pool was fantastic for everyone including kiss the swim up pool bar was always easy and happy hour in the afternoon was lovely the staff were always very helpful they had complimentary transfers to some reaches which was so easy especially with kiss would definitely stay again
excellent location with a short walk to the main strip of shops
amazing secluded pool to swim in and beach was safe
the rooms were lovely the beds so come and the setting is gorgeous
the breakfast and location were ok
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest   they replied very fast are easy to find and the pool is nice the rooms are cheap so do not expect  star luxury they let me rent the sooner an additional day even though we had to check out because the hotel was booked out otherwise we would have stayed longer
close to the beach
right on the beach and also in a good location for the bars and entertainment
it has the best environment you must probably need around all the island
it’s location was amazing shops bars restaurant etc were only walking distance from the place
they offer the best parties and have great pools and lovely beach
it is a good location of you want to be near the airport fro an early morning flight
view is simply amazingswimming pool sea
great hotel on the beach traveling with kiss who enjoyed the fantastic swimming pool close to everything staff very friendly and helpful clean neat rooms
nun restored supervisor is amazing  he is personally taking care of our food
i stayed in two different rooms here the first was the luxury left suit which was amazing all around windows two iron units and a big ceiling fan so very easy to achieve the perfect temperature and a fantastic bathroom
the second room was the luxury left studio slightly smaller but with a great balcony but after the first room it was a bit of a let down plus the bathroom floods very easy to fix they just need to install a raised runner at the shower entrance
all in all though a fabulous experience
the hosts were fantastic and very helpful rooms were spacious as cosy the views were breathtaking
staff especially data were great perfect location sea service and pool fantastic
good location can get an open back taxi to main strip rooms nice cleaned every day good size to staff are very friendly good pool area
fruhstuck hecker schemes ansicht
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
good location spacious rooms
our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
seats by the beach where u can relax and have a beer
fantastic property good food great service wish we could have stayed longer i feel  days was a little too short
pool view from the room and the amenities
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
location and facilities were fine but the wifi was poor
it was great that the kalb same was able to generally cater to dietary requirements such as vegetarian and glutenfree the rooms had lovely views were clean and spacious and the property in general was simple modern clean and beautiful the staff were polite and helpful
the staff were just lovely so very helpfulthe room was beautiful we stayed in the lamp suite and it was spacious and clean
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
very nice staff
perfect locationclose to the beach great breakfastgood internet nice pool hotel has everything you need great deal for the money you pay stuff upgrade us from standard room to superior room loved everything about this place
the wonderful staff were so friendly and helpful
great choice of food for breakfast
a very relaxing hotel
the room restaurant and pool is excellent manager and staff are super friendly
quiet and spacious accommodation good cocktail
nice location direct on the beach nice restaurant
i liked the free scuttle bus poland good breakfast
room was nice and big balcony had a good view of garden and mountain view
nice breeze and clean space behind to see the nature pool excellent with view of chewing city
great location
very helpful staff
the location is fantastic just a walk to the beach and also very near to the main markets
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
this was a nice property the pool was very clean and staff were great we liked our villa a lot
amazing facilities  swimming pool
shower not stable
old bathroom
room with no view and little dark because the window was covered by hotel signs
my room smelt of milder and the bed was really hard
nothing i could describe we didn like about the property
good moves on to at night but only in that
just had to think for five minutes because there really isn’t anything to improve maybe put a larger selection of spirits behind the bar but that is a minor thing
with the hotel itself  nothing big
only minor things like
the local road noise when in the restaurant small advertising trunks with loud speakers
the inside restaurant was not busy but plenty of local ones
local shopkeepers wanting your attention and custom
everything was good
price for breakfast
breakfast cleaning room
the pictures are huge misleading the rooms were dirty out dated and full of bags we were booked in to stay for longer but ended up leaving early for as a result of finding cockroaches in the bathroom
we stayed in the beachfront pool villa which was absolutely amazing just wish they had built the wall a bit higher so it could be more private as everyone swimming can see
not so close to white beach
small pool area we didn’t struggle to get a bed and it wasn’t crowded but i imagine in high season it is far too small for the number of rooms they have no lift for guests found it sufficient especially as it was included in our room price which was very cheap anyway but there was very little choice at the breakfast buffets
all in one bathshower hard mattress
no real separation in the room between the restroom and the main room
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel
fitness center was good but could do with a small update
overall very good but a kettle in room would of been nice but for cost of room can complain lock on door not the most secure
renovation done so voice and no easy access to the beach also breakfast delivered to the room not nice
the place was just below an acceptable level of cleanliness the bathroom is small and basic i like a firm bed but this was like sleeping on a sooner table didn find it as noisy at night as people suggest though
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited
toilet facilities can be improved no those to clean
there is only  mirror for use which is in the bathroom hence if someone is using the bathroom you cannot use a mirror  i would recommend a mirror in the main room as well plus the bathroom being a open area becomes too hot in summer i would recommend a fan in the bathroom
the garden room balconies are right opposite your neighbors so not exactly lounging outside type of stuff but who wants to sit on the balcony when you have the beach breakfast was average and very similar every day but fruit yoghurts eggs and the basis is all you need this is included in your hotel price so definitely worth it
shower didn get warm
too far from everything
our bed was a little squeaky if you made any movement
we travel south east asia constantly
last  months singapore long long tokyo and hi hi seat among ha in in thailand and this hotel overpriced for lack of facilities
no beach to speak of as  guests trying to enjoy  peters of water
i think the price was very high as the hotel was almost empty and our room was definitely not the best one
the swimming pools could do with some tic they were a little bit tired
i wished they had a small house restaurant least for breakfast
room and facilities
the room smelt of must and when you went to bed it felt like the sheets were wet every night
shower was lukewarm at best cold mostly and the same for the bath the water was too cold to have a bath which was a pity
we arranged a scuttle bus from airport but we waited  minutes before the driver got there and as we were paying for this scuttle it was a little annoying
it has potential to be a lovely resort but the gardens and pool area need a good overhauled as there was debris and leaves rubbish cardboard from new years eve celebrations lying around down by the loungers which were wooden with no fashioning my back was breaking after lying on it
the furniture is quite old  the self had a bad contact and random times when it didn open despite new batteries so we found it safe to keep our passports there
the restaurant is a bit prices for the small portions and regular quality
that hill is too much taxes charged more to drop up hill shower and toilet were broken
no hair dwyer room to no sound air conditioned not working well room design was just too basic bed sheets have some red stains
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
pillow and other staff at bed was horrible
beds not greatly comfortable and very strong smell of disinfectant
the bed was a little too hard for my liking and the iron was noisy
very noisy
shallow water for the beach
i didn like the way the russian manager spoke to me too much attitude no humility
lost my shirt and it want found again it was way too ugly to be stolen but it had sentimental value
shower only had cold water but i hear that normal for a lot of hotels in thailand
room smelled of senate very dark only lamps and no main light
the grm needs more attention with faulty equipment the air conditions are too old and noisy  you need transport to get to reaches and entertainment areas they have a scuttle bus but doesn leave often enough if you have a scootervancar then no problemeverything only minutes away
witness in the restraint with the infinity pool under the star restraint was rude and had a face like thunder
long walk into town beach was dirty
breakfast staff and coffee quality
we booked a cottage suite for myself and a pool cottage for my daughter which was more expensive than mine i would simply stick with the cottage suites i didn think that the pool cottage was any better both of us loved the outdoor bath in both units if you have mobility issues as i do having ms ask for accommodation close to the internal roadway to avoid many stairs to your room electric carts can then transport you anywhere within the grounds
the hotel is in the middle of bars with escort girls the noise insidethe rooms during the night is very high  you can not rest at night thehotel is adjacent to an industrial plant which there noise during they meaning  you not sleep at night and can not rest during the date internet  a big lie  can not surf and work online the hotelmanager claims that she has no obligation to provide internet becauseits free  watch out
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
internet is terrible they give you a paper with login and password for  weeks but you need to enter it again and again every  hours plus you need to keep this paper everytime with you because housekeeping is used to clean your room and take this paper away so you need to go downstairs for a new one
stairs if you room number is for than  you will have good exercises many times a day because there is no lift with children they dont give closed rooms
door is very old and you hear everyone who came back home at night generally you hear everything and everyone
breakfast is ok for such a price eggs mouse sausages toasts watermelon pineapple tea and coffee enough but very poor for me
pillows are very big and hard
no russian channels
room service was inconsistent  shower needs to be renovatednot soundproof
one of the mornings breakfast was slow and staff didn have enough english
airconditioning could not be operated normally
beach and sea are awful see through distance in water is only cm
the bungalow
location was a bit secluded but if your going for a relaxing break its perfect
for more absence and bigger choice of food walked to other end of beach to restaurant at sister resort crystal bay yacht club only a few minutes walk would have been nice to be told when we checked in that we could use the facilities at yacht club during our stay found out a few days in nice pool there
some of the bathroomshowers had a strong smell of urine
perhaps a little attention to the pool area its a little tiredifferent
would be nice suited to an adults only resort
shells in the bathroom dusty and rusty bad smell of suffer and humidity hairdryer was burnt air conditioning too loud after we complained we got another room with pleasant smell but still this place needs a takeover
the management who is rude and professional
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year
there are almost no bad things about this property to list the only thing that was a bit annoying was that the shower had almost no hot water on most occasions otherwise everything was very good
some noise during morning hours due to location
the whole place needs maintenance bad smell from the toilet
not much really the white sand extends out to sea so the snorkelling is not great unless you walk up the beach to the rocks a few hundred peters away apart from that we had a perfect stay
there was nothing not to like all amazing
sand at beach pretty coarse
facilities
the restaurant
her lines stickiges bad
airconditioning in bedroom was fan only
room was very small
sundry was a complete rip off
bath on the street bath at hotel
shower temperature was hard to control
rooms are very far apart with too many stairs if you can climb go for beach front cottages
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
bed a little lump and breakfast could start earlier  a little late esp if doing an early day trip need a coffee
room smells maybe mold or milder in closet restaurant menu is very limited ac fan goes straight to bed had to move bed not to freeze at night cheap plastic beach chairs
i liked everything
couldn fault this hotel
it’s hard to accept so much noise which lasts every night until gone  am perhaps rooms further back from the front are less noisy a pump made loud noise every  seconds behind our room
the coffee at breakfast was very poor
it should be nice have a lounge part the chairs in the restaurant are quit hard and  not come specially if you sit there fir a long time
each morning someone from guest services would walk through the breakfast area approaching people and ask them about their stay leaving date and so forth this was fine but it was a little irritating having stop eating mid breakfast to have a chat with them each day although we were only there for  days its nice they make the effort to engage with guests and make sure everything is ok so its not a big criticism but we just didn like it
isolated too quiet for us
location is poor as you have to take a taxi to the beach not with in walking distance from the hotel
the wifi is slow mostly everywhere
would be nice suited to an adults only resort
noise of iron
the grm was not good at all
only  yes  sunbeam around the pool a handful more at them bottom next to the beach but not on the beach as its a beach front property but has no beach so you can  sunbathe on just swim this was disappointing for metre sink bath and pools all need re grouping to help fresh them up otherwise it can look dirty
pool beach and sunbeam on the photo are not included in offered price another resort
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
hard to get sun loungers it was busy but not enough sun loungers
had to climb up clot of stairs there are  floors bit annoying with bags
little to do in the surroundings not areafood and taxes  on to same at pretty expensive compared to ha’am bangkok ayutthaya and thing may
having to leave to go back to the up
staff are less friendly  everything we asked we have got no answer  room was big but the air con  was not working even
after they fix it it was leaking
no hot water and everything is very expensive in the restaurant without any reason  one place near the hotel served better food with better atmosphere and with  less price
our recommendation is to go to the other places in that beach you will get better roi
the communication between the staff can be better we asked a few times for some drinks in our room and after the th time they finally brought us the drinks unfortantly it was half what we ordered
remember to bring with you snacks and food the hotel is far from city center and the restaurant isn cheap
you will stay all day at the hotel room so bring your own food
my ac would not go below c for the first  nights despite reporting it daily  eventually it was sorted to allow comfort although credit to engineer was at my door within  mind
nd day in hotel we had to call at pm to get our room cleaned
not much near hotel but i guess that why you go on holiday  to get away from it all perfect for that
the elevator was out of order and we have to use the stairs to the third floor
dogs barking at night
had a mouse in my room when i told them at the reception they said oh did she come back again  so they apparently knew it and still rented the room out one of the worst experiences i ever had
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
food was good but a bit costly location was a bit too far from everything
was a bit more money than i think it is worth i would recommend it if it was just a little bit cheaper as my standards were set a bit higher coming in
expensive for food and drink airport transfer was a rip off
not much choice for vegetarian breakfast  but minor detail
not a problem for me but pp with walking issues should keep in mind that the hotel is situated hillside
nothing really
trop de chamois
the bed in  is very loud also not firm or soft maybe was firm but now just overlay used
garage all over the beach so called private beach old and worn down house with ants crawling all over strong smell of urine in the bathroom the pool looked worn down with dirty water and you had to fill in some note to order breakfast the day before no restaurant except for the prepare breakfast
there were a bunch of dogs always around the entrance that was barking at us sometime and it scared my girlfriend
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
the water temperature for swimming pool to much cold need theater in jan
need more privacy for muslin couples on the sides of the pool
nothing at all
we chose the cheapest deal and our bungalow was right next to a busy main road so we didn get the best sleep but you get what you pay for the restaurant was overpriced it might be a good idea to provide guests with a little discount to incise them to eat there as there are cheaper option a short walk along the beach
nothing to dislike  that is with an month old with us
check snout was a bit slow and crowded
directly in from there is a wave breakers  stone wall and therefore the ocean is not as nice as a bit further west around m to the right at chewing garden beach resort opens up and becomes nice
airport picked offered was overpriced better use a regular taxi or shared taxi  bath per person
on site massage was two to three times the price of the beach massage just head right on the beach m and you have a  nice one we used regular for  bath per hour or head for the street behind where you have  bath per hour places as well
costs are considerable higher thank in other places there but your mileage may vary
i would like to stay again
the bathroom they need a serious uplifts
i’m being pick but if you didn’t secure a sun lounge in any of the areas by am you pretty much missed out
walls seemed really thin as we could hear everything going on in the halfway and rooms on either side of us
nobody speaks english
you need to pass the main road to get to the beach the beacharea is dirty but the hotel cleaned their part of it very goodthere is no supermarket around you need a taxi to get somewhere but they offer a free scuttle to lamp beach once a day
some refurbishment could be done like some wood flooring not great
leaving this wonderful place called tongs bay
free wifidid not work
poor quality and limited variety at breakfast tap water was running in yellow color
breakfast
beach was not that great and we were scared of all the wild dogs
air con not working great bathroom needs better lighting
probably this resort was a jewel like  years ago but now totally neglected broken things everywherevery poor the maintenance look nearly abandoned
horrible smell come through reception and restaurant
breakfast are miserable
construction but that temporary
busy roads of oh same
the whole villa smelt extremely dusty upon arrival and although it looked completely clean it smelt unclean it was also extremely dated and is desperate for a return wouldn’t personally stay here again but was okay for what we needed it for
pillow was too soft
trips are expensive through the hotel best to go down the main street to get good offers and discount we used mr tut for our snorkelling trip and loved it
there is nothing that we didn like about this property
no mirror in the bedroom and bad lighting in the bathroom
some mold in the bathroom right next to a that boxing stadium which caused noise on some evenings but it want too bad in my opinion
chewing beach was very littered with rubbish even if the hotel cleaned the area in front of the hotel the rest of the beach is just bad it is a shame that there are not people cleaning the beach every day as that will make a big impact chewing also becoming a lot like among in pocket where there are shops clubs everywhere some will like this and others wont some maintenance also required for the wood flooring in the rooms but i can imagine visitors with wet feet will create this constantly
just the mosquitoes it’d be great if the rooms had mosquito netsscreens
the swimming pool bar staff and return transfer driver didn seem to be in a good mood that the only tiny pity part
to small room small you took this room for one or for months not necessariprice for  night the same
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
i think a minor easily fixed issue which i read about in previous reviews too is there no soap or soap dish in the main wash basin in the bathroom its disappointing because people have commented on this before as well yes its easy to go buy a bar of soap once your out and about but its the first hotelresort give been to that doesn supply just a bar of soap not a big deal we made do by jumping the shower get into a cigarette tray for when we arrived until we could oriental ourselves and find a bar of soap
others have commented on the nuisance of mosquito spraying twice per week i see this as a positive thing  in tropical areas and especially if in humid rainforesty areas near streams like this property its natural to get mosquitoes at least this resort was practice  i believe there would be more complaints if they didn spray as you have muzzle bites instead even with repellent candles etc
slightly far out from the main street where all the markets are and the beach
had to drive to any shops
the photo and the description want accurate
the food and drinks bit expensive for the guests
room floor hasn been cleaned for whole stay same as bed sheets  nights no bed mistresses on the higher floor podiumduring showering water leaned on the floor bad designed battery noisy rooms through connecting doors to the next room
the rooms looks old complained about some issues but noonday cars
nothing at all
no kiss cartoon channel on to wifi was very poor almost not working in the bedroom there is no safeguard at the pool only pool attendants for towels and taking food or drink orders
its getting a bit tired needs some upbraiding done especially the bathroom
its disappointing for the rating displayed in bookingcom
there not enough space near the swimming poolbeach
the restaurant venue is very limited
you have to ask the staff to get food on the buffets its not great as well
the room jacuzzi was not cleaned during the week we states
electricity stopped working twice and water stopped once
its not that bad but very disappointing compared to what mentioned by most comments and the rating of
prices in restaurant
open bathroom which is only acceptable for couple noisy bed when moving and unstable
was a strong smell in the room was also very noisy throughout the night and early morning windows were difficult to shut cleaner would chuck folded clothes out of the way whilst cleaning
the hotel is very busy in the holiday season especially the israel holiday one
expect a bit of delays with rooms  the stuff is doing it out most to accommodate you with the limitation of a large busy hotel
come with a smile and a bit of patience  and you would enjoy your stay
disappointing the rooms facing the pool have no privacy  as well as the bathroom our biggest surprise was the dirty brown water in the bathroom when trying to shower we were given an excuse that something happened with the pipes and that we should wait to be fixed no suggestions of changing the soothe beach in the front is not the cleanest and the water is not suitable for swimming as its very shallow and full of sharp rocks
more option for breakfast would better
closed early very quiet after pm around the pool and bar area
everything was perfect
just a suggestion the rooms pictures dont express how nice they really are  check on instagram sareesamui to check it better
the beach of the hotel is not so nice has a lot of seated going norhsouth  peters and you find a wonderful beach
the pool is almost all of the time dirty because of the trees above and some insects around
some of the rooms are little old and need a little renovation
staff doesn speak good english
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
we changed the room we booked because it was in a bad old condition and very smell they offered us another room but it looked the same in the end we had to pay more for another room
there was a lot of trash around us the stuff cleaned very irregular people working there speak hardly english and it was difficult to communicate we were in general very disappointed
wifi is the worst give seen in the whole of thailand and there not gathered about fixing it try evergreen wifi next door guest same but this doesn work on my phone only lawton
the beach was stone
after we took our meals from the breakfast open buffets we saw a huge insect in our plate it was dead and covered with sauce obviously cooked with the past it was not a nice experience we called he staff and they removed the paget from the buffets  helene conditions could be improved
didn have hot water in the shower for  out of  days the pool was supposed to b open till  but when we came on  it was closed
breakfast a bit dull nut enough option for little children had to ask for many things like changing towels toilet paper etc
bathroom is nice and clean but isn have many danger and i dont like the way they put shower and toilet in the same place would be better if they have shower curtain
sunbeam very quite uncomfortable with no cushions  also could have done with a few more umbrella
there are  things which could be better
modern air con with a hemp setting  that stays on when you leave the room
 the shower swing from cold to boiling without turning a dial and the pressure is not great
 the quickness of the rooms is generally good but you do hear corridor noise and doors banging
for sum reason the white wine is very expensive this is not a dislike but have suggested to the hotel staff to replace their did films to media files
room facilities maintenance suggest the management allocate rooms according to the visitors type honeymoons families etc
water not deep enough to swim all day in the sea
maybe just the lightblue coloured walls in the room they could have chosen a brighter rosier color but this is minor
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
noisy from swimming pool  old furniture
no toilet paper
the privilege card is not what it seems dont go there
my room was next to hotel accounting office all the time while entering to office i wake up by their noiseextra water will be charged
overhead planes are ridiculously loud you will be women up even with ear plugs in would not recommend staying in the flight path and suggest paying slightly more for a taxi to airport
the rooms where to small and not enough cupboard space to unpack clothes and the pool bar was to expensive
food was poor and staff very inexperienced
the room very small and not like in the photo the room was clean but in the bathroom was a lot of hair
hotel taxi service is too expensive scuttle to nearest market area would be very helpful
current house activities are not interestingresort of such scale should have house activity centre  more fun indoor and outdoor activities for guests in  boardgames beach games conduct and into snorkelling kayaking other water related classes for guests  could also have more activities for kiss water playground movie screening etc
a lot of cat’s
the lights inside the room could be brighter they should also consider providing the rooms with something to hang your clothes to dry after returning from the pool
the rooms are decade you cannot open the windows the cleaning is bad in front of the beach there is a loud and pouting water jet station the sea level is very low so you cannot swim the bar prices are way over the average
property a bit run down restaurant not good
swimmingpool not really clean garden the safe is not a safe it is a kind of not fixed box
nothing everything was perfect
a little bit far from the centre but the free scuttle bus was really good
nothing to complain about at all we had a great stay  so did our friends x  others
breakfast could be more various croissants and other guns are incredible  really not taste
there is a kiss playing room but almost no toys in it
overpriced no value for money the pool party is highly operated
room was not clean and had a very bad smell
shower heads   and pressure  the property needs   a make over  bathroom  etc  just   a spruce up
its looking a bit tired floppy painting group all round the side of the basin from installation many years ago poor attention to detail in that respect
mattress was a bit hard and the pillow not very comfortable
its a simple  star resort and doesn try to be anything else breakfast was basic not much atmosphere at the hotel
the private pool is bit smaller not like what it was shown in the picture the loud music from the near local bars at night
double bed rather than  singles
the breakfast was soto and could be improved a bit area is very tourist but that chewing and to be expected bathroom was steaming hot as it has open windows and ac doesn work for the bathroom
no fan in bathroom
that every time i popped to reception no one was there i always had to call them to let them know i was in reception from my international number
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
no swimming pool
room service menu could have been a bit more extensive
the area behind the resort is not very appealing the bar and restaurant are a little over prices
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable
the beach its rocky
iron is a bit loud during the night
housekeeping was generally good but could have been more consistent occasionally bath towels were missed or tea bags not supplied or a reduced number of water bottles however these were minor matters so there isn too much to improve
the beach in front is just small and full of boats it was the first time in my travel life that i did use the pool instead of the sea
restaurant reservation system or better the beach front tables are reserved for outside guests for dinner  pro form i was a little  disappointed as i wanted to have dinner to celebrate my birthday and there where like  tables directly at the beach viewside empty but we as guests having dinner have not been asked to switch to an empty table later on when we have been in the middle of our menu the stuff finally asked us  ok that good but just after the tables have been empty for a long time and guests from outside where not expected anymore when we reserved the table a day before we where told there are no free tables not a big disadvantage but we stayed there especially to have dinner  so it was a disadvantage to us p
wifi in the room could have been better  it was good on the balcony and outside the door of the room but not good in the room itself
the shower room is a bit old and not clean
the hotel is run down and in need of much loving tic  room as not cleaned to a satisfactory standard  staff on reception should honestly sharpen their customer service skill as they are the first face you see when you arrive  bar and restaurant are overpriced for what you get  but they know what they can get away with as the local restaurant are totally over the top
the security of personal belongings and the location
the dining area could have been made more attractive and brighter at night   the gloominess could have led most guests to eat elsewhere at night compared to the numbers at breakfast
internet was only free near reception given the price of this hotel and the modern era should have wifi everywhere and shouldn have to pay extra the steps and floors can be slippery if it has been raining also not a fan of the wandering dogs either take plenty of insect repellent my legs and arms were covered in bites after the first night
the room cleaning is poor and slow broken chair is still missing break and dinner is even for thailand expensive and not really good
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful
bit far that ok they dont have cattle that bad
但其实别处也没什么可逛的……
the resort would be more appropriate call by
is in the front of the pier with a constant smell of diese the beach is 	
impracticable due to the locking of ferries the pool would be ideal for children if they respected the heights the value for money is indecent the same type of structure can be found below the half price  in general i do not recommend it to anyone the worst place of same
shower had really few waterpressure made it hard to wash my long hair like a proper duvetblanket instead of the sheetblanketsheet thing they had
of of харесаче е of твърде изолирано място и of ограничен в избор of дейности като разходки и забавления
would be perfect if it has sundry room inside the hotel
the place is very noisy
too many stairs and not much can be done about it as it’s literally carved in a hill

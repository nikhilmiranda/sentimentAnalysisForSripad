the rooms and balcony were awesome service was excellent everyone was so attentive and went out their way to help
the porters and room service staff were really good and helpful always willing to help out with a smile on their face
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
this hotel is my absolute favourite the view of the beach is amazing itâ€™s not too busy so you can enjoy the beach and hotel facilities without any haste the rooms are cleaned twice a day morning and evening with thoughtful added things like lighting a candle in the evening or leaving a fruit basket as a welcome â€˜presentâ€™ the service is the best i received in thailand all members of staff are smile positive chatty and so welcoming they are always there to help you even before you realise you need help ðŸ™‚ absolutely impressed and would definitely go back
only  yes  sunbeam around the pool a handful more at them bottom next to the beach but not on the beach as its a beach front property but has no beach so you can  sunbathe on just swim this was disappointing for metre sink bath and pools all need re grouping to help fresh them up otherwise it can look dirty
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague

hillside pool suites are really nice and absolutely worth the extra money
to pay so much money and not sleep well is a waste of money and vacation time 
staff in the reception was trying to charge me more money for a taxi then actual cost its a big shame that hotel staff are thinking how to screw their guests
the character of the hotel is fabulous the staff warm professional and friendly the food great and the situation the prime location on the chewing mon beachfronti would have rate the hotel  based on my very first impression but i have to say it grew on me splash of cash at least  years overdue
stunning gardens excellent pool areas and great beachside facilities  this resort has had a huge amount of effort put in to it with a lot of attention to detail
the property was great value for money we got our room upgrade for free and the staff were so accommodation
overpriced nothing much and this is a strictly a cash business so dont think about paying your balance with your isa card  i had to walk to the cash machine and the staff graciously let me check in and pay the balance later i mean come one they say we only take isa and when i show them my isa card they pull that passive  aggressive that stuff ah ohhhi i i sorry i dont speak english  the room was poker and it had stairs so if you are traveling with young children you may consider this  the room was just ok far from town poker concrete and nothing special  the pool was small and the staff ok after i paid them in cash  there are two eating spots close by which are fair and tiny store which haswater  ok enough in glad i escaped
staff was courteous practice and emphatic the food in buffets was fresh and appealing there were also more option provided in the hot and cold beverages compare to the other hotels the room was spacious and had all the amenities and moreover it was kept really clean and tidy for a lawless stay the sooty facility was available with the hotel  hence there was absolutely no need to submit your passport to the outside vendor overall complete value for money
fantastic hostel we stayed in the private  bedroom room with shared bathroom the rooms were clean and had air conditioning very happy with the staff and facilities at the hostel  value for money
good value for money and lovely personnel
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest   they replied very fast are easy to find and the pool is nice the rooms are cheap so do not expect  star luxury they let me rent the sooner an additional day even though we had to check out because the hotel was booked out otherwise we would have stayed longer
perfect locationclose to the beach great breakfastgood internet nice pool hotel has everything you need great deal for the money you pay stuff upgrade us from standard room to superior room loved everything about this place
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at
was a bit more money than i think it is worth i would recommend it if it was just a little bit cheaper as my standards were set a bit higher coming in
the privilege card is not what it seems dont go there
overpriced no value for money the pool party is highly operated
impracticable due to the locking of ferries the pool would be ideal for children if they respected the heights the value for money is indecent the same type of structure can be found below the half price  in general i do not recommend it to anyone the worst place of same

nothing really unlikable nighttime a little quiet
the resort was very pretty it was lovely being able to sit by the beach with a drink despite the fact it is in the middle of chewing with all the nighttime the resort itself is very quiet the breakfast was amazing
more or less private beach nice quiet location clean tidy nice gardens and pool
quiet yet next to fisherman village service staff venue beach and pool all great
proximity to beach very quiet
great location right off main strip quiet spacious and clean room very sweet staff
the beach front bungalow was great  lovely views  the staff was very friendly and the bar man couldn do enough lovely food  if you just want peace and quiet this is for you
the passage was an amazing hotel to stay at during our visit to oh same with a stunning location a wonderful beach excellent food in the beautiful restaurant there was so much to enjoy in this tranquil and luxurious resort we particularly liked the fact that it was the low season and it was quite quiet exactly what we were looking for away from the rustle and bustle of the east coast of the island the accommodation was also excellent well maintained clean and lovely with attentive and friendly staff i really can recommend the passage enough a gem wait for you to discover

quiet and relaxing
balcony with review over quiet beach
very nice and quiet place to chill and to sleep at night beautiful garden
burial beach very quiet far from crowded center
literally next to the beach very friendly and helpful staff restaurant and super markets are in min walking distance quiet environment in the night great breakfast buffets
amazing place so beautiful and quiet exactly what we wanted stay here
amazing stay i stayed for  nights and can hardly find a fault with weimar the resort is stylish and tranquil with a fabulous pool with a swim up bar and happy hour everyday to enjoy all the delicious cocktail they have to offer the food in the restaurant was great  we particularly enjoyed the saturday night by where we had amazing speak and pawns while listening to a very talented live musician one of the highlight of our stay the clientele is mostly young couples giving the place a very calm and relaxed vice we didn’t try any of the activities offered but there would be lots to do for anyone looking for a more active stay especially for those interested in exercise and you overall a wonderful stay and one of the best hotels i have visited
quiet resort with lots of green and direct to a quiet part of the beach
wonderful breakfast area with open view of the sea the iron was good and we could set it to be cool without getting cold we got a place on the private beach every day and it didn’t feel crowded a really pleasant beach
beautiful cabin with view of the sea and palm trees  very quiet and peaceful and very helpful staff good food
breakfast was lavish served at the restaurant overlooking the beach the beach was clean and calm and the resort offered free kayaks cases life jackets for the guests
beautiful hotel and grounds free  minute welcome massage at the sea friendly helpful staff breakfast box was prepared for me when i had to leave early and missed the buffets shutters available for free to and from town lots of fun things to do cool reef to snorted in in the bay
the property was amazing  we received a free upgrade from a poolside to a villa poolside apartment which was very spacious  the location was very quiet and enabled us a spectacular view to the sea the food was great fresh fruit cake or biscuits were freely provided daily the staff were awesome entertainment provided both day and night so you didn’t need to go venture out we felt well pampered on our last day we enjoyed a couples full body massage it was our first time having this that treatment a super end to our holiday  we will definitely be visiting again
the food was absolutely delicious and of very high quality english speaking staff gorgeous beach private to hotel residents and the water was calm enough to go swimming even during the month of august excellent facilities and activities on site there is so much to do and we didn feel the need to go elsewhere we loved the private gardens cycling and visiting the animal farm property and villas are so romantic hands down one of the best properties i have been to so far with my partner and worth every penny
the beach where the hotel is located is one of the best of the island plenty of nice restaurant on the beach but quiet and not too crowded
the rooms are so big and comfortable the staff are amazing and so helpful i like their food as well and beach is incredible  its a quiet place and good for relaxing
the place the view the beach is quiet and beautiful the that restaurant is good people are very pleasant
bout area seems to be one of the nicest parts of same within it the peace resort felt like an oasis of calm and quality enough facilities breakfast receptionists sunbeam etc for all guests even in busy season
quiet and spacious accommodation good cocktail
isolated too quiet for us
closed early very quiet after pm around the pool and bar area

i booked the sea view pool villa but it barely had a sea view due to buildings in the way
the swimming pool have a very nice view the sea was normal but good view
the sea view staff very kindness clearness global except room glasses
i booked the villa with private pool very nice accommodation with a beautiful view one little point of critic the room seemed slightly outdated 
the photo are totally accurate of the hillside pool villa it really was the most spectacular view and a beautiful place to spend the first week of our honeymoon
the rooms were far and the whole scene experience
the view of the beach is spoiled by electricity posts and wires
view from the room was very bad
view and garden
the swimming pool is very nice with amazing view 
nice breakfast nice view nice garden
everything was perfect the view from the room come bed nice swimming pool  min walk from the main road
the room was lovely and the view from the balcony i was in the sunrise jacuzzi room was amazing the staff were all very helpful and friendly and the location is great  on the quieter end of chewing beach but still close to the action
we preferred the kalb hotel for our honeymoon was great hotel the located in silence area a bit far from center but view was amazing and you will be able to listen seaâ€™s voice  i checked more then  hotels in same lovely stuff they are always smiling breakfast was also obey and at our last day we changed our room to pool villa  all included  lunch and dinner was perfect
location  view from balcony  clean and big rooms
scene beautyspacomfortable bed hospitality
lovely resort the swimming pool has an amazing view and our room with outdoor bath was lovely and spacious we read in the reviews the road was very steep and we thought it might be a bit of an exaggeration but it really is steep the views up the hill are stunning though we met a couple who were staying at the executive suite in room  and they had the most breath taking view from their balcony so the view depends a bit on which room you have
huge rooms clean good price excellent pool excellent view photo on bookingcom dont do it justice restaurant is nice and they do room service at no extra cost water every day for the fridge along with room cleaned kettle in room free tea no coffee big flat screen to plenty of sockets nice porch to sit on to eat staff are really nice best place we stayed in in all of se asia
nothing good i really dont like it need to change every thing in room because its look so old
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
wonderful breakfast area with open view of the sea the iron was good and we could set it to be cool without getting cold we got a place on the private beach every day and it didnâ€™t feel crowded a really pleasant beach
we had the suite on beach very comfortable room and view is amazing the owner has just put in machine that converts humidity into water will be once you know how to work it need instructions
pool and view
this hotel is my absolute favourite the view of the beach is amazing itâ€™s not too busy so you can enjoy the beach and hotel facilities without any haste the rooms are cleaned twice a day morning and evening with thoughtful added things like lighting a candle in the evening or leaving a fruit basket as a welcome â€˜presentâ€™ the service is the best i received in thailand all members of staff are smile positive chatty and so welcoming they are always there to help you even before you realise you need help ðŸ™‚ absolutely impressed and would definitely go back
beautiful cabin with view of the sea and palm trees  very quiet and peaceful and very helpful staff good food
not a lot to say as everything was perfect  brilliant staff beautiful rooms  perfect location if your looking for your piece of paradise then look no further
overall we liked the hotel it is new and modern room and bathroom was really big were got the pool view room with a nice terrace which was nice the best part of the hotel is the pool area  i have never seen such a huge pool grm is well equipped as well
the property was amazing  we received a free upgrade from a poolside to a villa poolside apartment which was very spacious  the location was very quiet and enabled us a spectacular view to the sea the food was great fresh fruit cake or biscuits were freely provided daily the staff were awesome entertainment provided both day and night so you didnâ€™t need to go venture out we felt well pampered on our last day we enjoyed a couples full body massage it was our first time having this that treatment a super end to our holiday  we will definitely be visiting again
amazing open air breakfast with pool and beach view fresh juices prepared instantly for you that and europeanwestern choice ice cream corner for little kiss nice setting high chairs for the little ones
stayed in a deluge pool view room on ground floor it was better than the direct pool acres rooms
the place the view the beach is quiet and beautiful the that restaurant is good people are very pleasant
lovely bungalows but the pool view room was noisy and dated small resort great pool good restaurant on the beach
hotel was absolutely amazing was right by the markets on friday nights and far enough away from the center so it want noisy at night the hotel was amazing the staff couldn do enough and the view from the rooftop pool was breathtaking perfect for a couple would go back without a doubt
the staff in the restaurant where great so lovely worked so hard and nothing was to much for them the pool was lovely and the view now
view is simply amazingswimming pool sea
pool view from the room and the amenities
room was nice and big balcony had a good view of garden and mountain view
nice breeze and clean space behind to see the nature pool excellent with view of chewing city
room with no view and little dark because the window was covered by hotel signs
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year
only  yes  sunbeam around the pool a handful more at them bottom next to the beach but not on the beach as its a beach front property but has no beach so you can  sunbathe on just swim this was disappointing for metre sink bath and pools all need re grouping to help fresh them up otherwise it can look dirty
probably this resort was a jewel like  years ago but now totally neglected broken things everywherevery poor the maintenance look nearly abandoned
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes

fantastic hostel we stayed in the private  bedroom room with shared bathroom the rooms were clean and had air conditioning very happy with the staff and facilities at the hostel  value for money
travelled with family during this month and we booked deluge room at first we were greeted by very courteous staff and well informed in our room after the checking timothy room is very clean and spacious unlike what other people write on the reviews saying its dirty cleaning is done everyday including changing of bedsheets and pillow sheets rooms service can be ordered until  pm and breakfast everyday was surprisingly enough and lots of variation its delirious specially my favorite wattle can also order vegetarian food just need to inform the staffs were entertained by dandy who very attentive in our needs service with a smile as always since we are vegetarian dandy helped us in every way he never gets tired whatever we need as well as to other guest once called by his name well known for his being so friendly as i guests encountered some ac problem but it was solved immediately after being told to fix and they are very apologetic the fact it occurs one takeover all our holiday was perfect and the best  since bring staffs and management are all very helpful to make our family holiday the way we wanted we even got a free transfer to airport arranged by dandy thank you to mr thaippine days boss as he always said😊👍 thank you the bring management and we will definitely comeback with our friend as we already advertised it to all of our friends in indian must visited than other hotel which is expensive worth the value as i can say missing the place now and had a lovely memory with dandy from philippines for being so hospitable and taking care of us specially my   yes old daughter misha
aah what a lovely place this is right off the main street and close to the beach supermarket and restaurant all around the ladies here are so nice and helpful the room is fabulous and super clean i enjoyed my stay here clot
staff was nicegreat location although a little bit noisy at night can blame the hotel for this its nor their faultroom was clean bed very comfortable and bathroom was nice
pools  are great fun and clean infinity pool
the staff were fantastic the rooms and all facilities were very clean spacious and the resort was small so it never felt busy the pool was fantastic for everyone including kiss the swim up pool bar was always easy and happy hour in the afternoon was lovely the staff were always very helpful they had complimentary transfers to some reaches which was so easy especially with kiss would definitely stay again
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest   they replied very fast are easy to find and the pool is nice the rooms are cheap so do not expect  star luxury they let me rent the sooner an additional day even though we had to check out because the hotel was booked out otherwise we would have stayed longer
great hotel on the beach traveling with kiss who enjoyed the fantastic swimming pool close to everything staff very friendly and helpful clean neat rooms
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
it was great that the kalb same was able to generally cater to dietary requirements such as vegetarian and glutenfree the rooms had lovely views were clean and spacious and the property in general was simple modern clean and beautiful the staff were polite and helpful
the staff were just lovely so very helpfulthe room was beautiful we stayed in the lamp suite and it was spacious and clean
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
nice breeze and clean space behind to see the nature pool excellent with view of chewing city
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
this was a nice property the pool was very clean and staff were great we liked our villa a lot
toilet facilities can be improved no those to clean
internet is terrible they give you a paper with login and password for  weeks but you need to enter it again and again every  hours plus you need to keep this paper everytime with you because housekeeping is used to clean your room and take this paper away so you need to go downstairs for a new one
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year
only  yes  sunbeam around the pool a handful more at them bottom next to the beach but not on the beach as its a beach front property but has no beach so you can  sunbathe on just swim this was disappointing for metre sink bath and pools all need re grouping to help fresh them up otherwise it can look dirty
the whole villa smelt extremely dusty upon arrival and although it looked completely clean it smelt unclean it was also extremely dated and is desperate for a return wouldn’t personally stay here again but was okay for what we needed it for
bathroom is nice and clean but isn have many danger and i dont like the way they put shower and toilet in the same place would be better if they have shower curtain
the room very small and not like in the photo the room was clean but in the bathroom was a lot of hair
swimmingpool not really clean garden the safe is not a safe it is a kind of not fixed box
room was not clean and had a very bad smell
the shower room is a bit old and not clean

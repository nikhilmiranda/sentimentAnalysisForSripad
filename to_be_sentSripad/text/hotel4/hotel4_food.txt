fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the location was incredible  the value for the location is a steal  the food was a good price and the service was great and the food was average but very good for the price
nun restored supervisor is amazing  he is personally taking care of our food
fantastic property good food great service wish we could have stayed longer i feel  days was a little too short
great choice of food for breakfast
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
for more absence and bigger choice of food walked to other end of beach to restaurant at sister resort crystal bay yacht club only a few minutes walk would have been nice to be told when we checked in that we could use the facilities at yacht club during our stay found out a few days in nice pool there
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
no hot water and everything is very expensive in the restaurant without any reason  one place near the hotel served better food with better atmosphere and with  less price
remember to bring with you snacks and food the hotel is far from city center and the restaurant isn cheap
you will stay all day at the hotel room so bring your own food
food was good but a bit costly location was a bit too far from everything
expensive for food and drink airport transfer was a rip off
i think a minor easily fixed issue which i read about in previous reviews too is there no soap or soap dish in the main wash basin in the bathroom its disappointing because people have commented on this before as well yes its easy to go buy a bar of soap once your out and about but its the first hotelresort give been to that doesn supply just a bar of soap not a big deal we made do by jumping the shower get into a cigarette tray for when we arrived until we could oriental ourselves and find a bar of soap
the food and drinks bit expensive for the guests
no kiss cartoon channel on to wifi was very poor almost not working in the bedroom there is no safeguard at the pool only pool attendants for towels and taking food or drink orders
you have to ask the staff to get food on the buffets its not great as well
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
food was poor and staff very inexperienced
the beach isn wonderful so i would not stay there for longer that a night or two unless you are not a beach person another strange thing about resorts in same is that there agent any ranges passion fruit or other exotic fruits included there i really missed that

fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the location was incredible  the value for the location is a steal  the food was a good price and the service was great and the food was average but very good for the price
nun restored supervisor is amazing  he is personally taking care of our food
fantastic property good food great service wish we could have stayed longer i feel  days was a little too short
great choice of food for breakfast
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
for more absence and bigger choice of food walked to other end of beach to restaurant at sister resort crystal bay yacht club only a few minutes walk would have been nice to be told when we checked in that we could use the facilities at yacht club during our stay found out a few days in nice pool there
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
no hot water and everything is very expensive in the restaurant without any reason  one place near the hotel served better food with better atmosphere and with  less price
remember to bring with you snacks and food the hotel is far from city center and the restaurant isn cheap
you will stay all day at the hotel room so bring your own food
food was good but a bit costly location was a bit too far from everything
expensive for food and drink airport transfer was a rip off
i think a minor easily fixed issue which i read about in previous reviews too is there no soap or soap dish in the main wash basin in the bathroom its disappointing because people have commented on this before as well yes its easy to go buy a bar of soap once your out and about but its the first hotelresort give been to that doesn supply just a bar of soap not a big deal we made do by jumping the shower get into a cigarette tray for when we arrived until we could oriental ourselves and find a bar of soap
the food and drinks bit expensive for the guests
no kiss cartoon channel on to wifi was very poor almost not working in the bedroom there is no safeguard at the pool only pool attendants for towels and taking food or drink orders
you have to ask the staff to get food on the buffets its not great as well
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
food was poor and staff very inexperienced

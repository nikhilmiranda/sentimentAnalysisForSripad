the wifi was great 
very nice place   clean room clean pool  clean and beautiful beach  very good position beautiful garden  good wifi nice staff
adult only hotel review from room breakfast pool free daily program for guest speedy and stable wifi anywhere in hotel
location and facilities were fine but the wifi was poor
perfect locationclose to the beach great breakfastgood internet nice pool hotel has everything you need great deal for the money you pay stuff upgrade us from standard room to superior room loved everything about this place
the hotel is in the middle of bars with escort girls the noise insidethe rooms during the night is very high  you can not rest at night thehotel is adjacent to an industrial plant which there noise during they meaning  you not sleep at night and can not rest during the date internet  a big lie  can not surf and work online the hotelmanager claims that she has no obligation to provide internet becauseits free  watch out
internet is terrible they give you a paper with login and password for  weeks but you need to enter it again and again every  hours plus you need to keep this paper everytime with you because housekeeping is used to clean your room and take this paper away so you need to go downstairs for a new one
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
the wifi is slow mostly everywhere
no kiss cartoon channel on to wifi was very poor almost not working in the bedroom there is no safeguard at the pool only pool attendants for towels and taking food or drink orders
wifi is the worst give seen in the whole of thailand and there not gathered about fixing it try evergreen wifi next door guest same but this doesn work on my phone only lawton
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
wifi in the room could have been better  it was good on the balcony and outside the door of the room but not good in the room itself
internet was only free near reception given the price of this hotel and the modern era should have wifi everywhere and shouldn have to pay extra the steps and floors can be slippery if it has been raining also not a fan of the wandering dogs either take plenty of insect repellent my legs and arms were covered in bites after the first night

very very bad stuff not friendly very far rooms you should walk to the reception after breakfast to take a car to go your room when i want to order water in breakfast they told me go to and bring your water

we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall
lack of english language by staff too many tourist come all staff she be speaking in  resort  need a life guard at the pools and stop kiss from jumping
check in early n checkout late was nightmare staff has high attitude on above topics
staff very helpful and going the extra mile
customer service from the reception desk was not in keeping with the rest of the hotel
a lot of rooms were too far from the breakfast area and the walk back to the  room was very firing the golf car service was only available from the reception and not from the breakfast area the climb is too firing
staff
staff in the reception was trying to charge me more money for a taxi then actual cost its a big shame that hotel staff are thinking how to screw their guests
staff

we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant on the last night and it was delicious the pool was very nice and clean and the staff were wonderful
the character of the hotel is fabulous the staff warm professional and friendly the food great and the situation the prime location on the chewing mon beachfronti would have rate the hotel  based on my very first impression but i have to say it grew on me splash of cash at least  years overdue

breakfast buffets was very good with a big choice and waiter service for the main course which meant that you receive warm eggs self service for extra like fresh fruit toast etc oh why can  hotels in thailand get faster masters nut the customer service lady  i think was exceptional she seemed to make a point of scurrying around at breakfast greeting guests and making sure they were happy and she always remembered my name my room was on the first floor and was well appointed and very comfortable beach at the hotel was well kept and clean plenty of sunbeam and a nice beach side bar good hotel with very good and pleasant staff and far enough away from chewing nighttime and noise to be able to get a good nights sleep
the staff are friendly they offered us free dinner to  apologize for ants in the room very good location
the staff
but the staff is good
loved the location  it is right at the end of fisherman village a true little boutique resort  our included breakfast was perfect every morning  everything was clean and the maid cleaned our room so quickly
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
excellent location peaceful loved our bungalow very clean staff were very attentive
overpriced nothing much and this is a strictly a cash business so dont think about paying your balance with your isa card  i had to walk to the cash machine and the staff graciously let me check in and pay the balance later i mean come one they say we only take isa and when i show them my isa card they pull that passive  aggressive that stuff ah ohhhi i i sorry i dont speak english  the room was poker and it had stairs so if you are traveling with young children you may consider this  the room was just ok far from town poker concrete and nothing special  the pool was small and the staff ok after i paid them in cash  there are two eating spots close by which are fair and tiny store which haswater  ok enough in glad i escaped
very good location great staff so so helpful manger is very helpful speaks good english so easy to talk to
staff was courteous practice and emphatic the food in buffets was fresh and appealing there were also more option provided in the hot and cold beverages compare to the other hotels the room was spacious and had all the amenities and moreover it was kept really clean and tidy for a lawless stay the sooty facility was available with the hotel  hence there was absolutely no need to submit your passport to the outside vendor overall complete value for money
excellent location friendly and helpful staff have just been enjoying my stay there
friendly staff nice little pool on chewing beach but slightly north and away from the busy beach
location was good most staff friendly king size bed
good location right on the beach and close to bars and restaurant friendly staff
this hotel is my absolute favourite the view of the beach is amazing it’s not too busy so you can enjoy the beach and hotel facilities without any haste the rooms are cleaned twice a day morning and evening with thoughtful added things like lighting a candle in the evening or leaving a fruit basket as a welcome ‘present’ the service is the best i received in thailand all members of staff are smile positive chatty and so welcoming they are always there to help you even before you realise you need help 🙂 absolutely impressed and would definitely go back
beautiful cabin with view of the sea and palm trees  very quiet and peaceful and very helpful staff good food
amazing woman in the reception extremely helpful with everything from giving us recommendations to helping us get a free transport to the pier do not miss the restaurant called brown sugar next to the entrance or the sunday market
bed and pillows were really comfortable terrace with poolview was also pretty beautiful science in our room privacy and very nice atmosphere in whole resort rich breakfast with nice poolview and very nice and helpful smiling staff
not a lot to say as everything was perfect  brilliant staff beautiful rooms  perfect location if your looking for your piece of paradise then look no further
the staff are really helpful and friendly the french lady at the reception helped us make our trip great the property is located in a quite side of oh same however food was never a problem as there are many good beach side restaurant around the property  definitely i will recommend this place to a friend
the staff were very friendly and the hotel was situated in a nice place close to beach and shops
from our arrival at the reception where we were greeted by the lovely staff with such warmth and care till they day we left the experience was unforgettable throughout our stay it felt like being at home away from home
the staff were fantastic so helpful and kind i had everything i could need and more upgrade on arrival wonderful food a tailor on site to make a gorgeous dress in his pool and gardens are maintained all the time and trip around island was fun
beautiful hotel and grounds free  minute welcome massage at the sea friendly helpful staff breakfast box was prepared for me when i had to leave early and missed the buffets shutters available for free to and from town lots of fun things to do cool reef to snorted in in the bay

clean peaceful place staff is good
wonderful luxury villas with private pools very friendly polite and helpful staff very much enjoyed our stay
a wonderfully relaxed break at this boutique hotel  staff were excellent and perhaps what makes this such a great place to stay  ideally located
the food was absolutely delicious and of very high quality english speaking staff gorgeous beach private to hotel residents and the water was calm enough to go swimming even during the month of august excellent facilities and activities on site there is so much to do and we didn feel the need to go elsewhere we loved the private gardens cycling and visiting the animal farm property and villas are so romantic hands down one of the best properties i have been to so far with my partner and worth every penny
i wish i would have booked a different hotel the staff were really great and had amazing massage ladies at the resort on the beach the beach itself was very nice and loved how you could get food and drinks delivered to you on they beach the price of the food and drinks were cheap and tasted amazing
staff went above and beyond
great location nice beach and exceptional absence throughout the resort friendly welcoming manager and staff swasana massage is a must

it’s an amazing place well designed anantara style best breakfast buffets i’ve ever seen happy staff
hotel was absolutely amazing was right by the markets on friday nights and far enough away from the center so it want noisy at night the hotel was amazing the staff couldn do enough and the view from the rooftop pool was breathtaking perfect for a couple would go back without a doubt
very pleasant hotel beautiful room can say about the location we only stayed there to be close to the airport on our last night in oh same staff is incredibly nice and efficient though

fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the staff were fantastic the rooms and all facilities were very clean spacious and the resort was small so it never felt busy the pool was fantastic for everyone including kiss the swim up pool bar was always easy and happy hour in the afternoon was lovely the staff were always very helpful they had complimentary transfers to some reaches which was so easy especially with kiss would definitely stay again
great hotel on the beach traveling with kiss who enjoyed the fantastic swimming pool close to everything staff very friendly and helpful clean neat rooms
staff especially data were great perfect location sea service and pool fantastic
good location can get an open back taxi to main strip rooms nice cleaned every day good size to staff are very friendly good pool area
our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
it was great that the kalb same was able to generally cater to dietary requirements such as vegetarian and glutenfree the rooms had lovely views were clean and spacious and the property in general was simple modern clean and beautiful the staff were polite and helpful
the staff were just lovely so very helpfulthe room was beautiful we stayed in the lamp suite and it was spacious and clean
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
very nice staff
the wonderful staff were so friendly and helpful
the room restaurant and pool is excellent manager and staff are super friendly
very helpful staff
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
this was a nice property the pool was very clean and staff were great we liked our villa a lot
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
pillow and other staff at bed was horrible
breakfast staff and coffee quality
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
one of the mornings breakfast was slow and staff didn have enough english
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
staff are less friendly  everything we asked we have got no answer  room was big but the air con  was not working even
the communication between the staff can be better we asked a few times for some drinks in our room and after the th time they finally brought us the drinks unfortantly it was half what we ordered
had a mouse in my room when i told them at the reception they said oh did she come back again  so they apparently knew it and still rented the room out one of the worst experiences i ever had
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
horrible smell come through reception and restaurant
the swimming pool bar staff and return transfer driver didn seem to be in a good mood that the only tiny pity part
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
you have to ask the staff to get food on the buffets its not great as well
staff doesn speak good english
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
after we took our meals from the breakfast open buffets we saw a huge insect in our plate it was dead and covered with sauce obviously cooked with the past it was not a nice experience we called he staff and they removed the paget from the buffets  helene conditions could be improved
for sum reason the white wine is very expensive this is not a dislike but have suggested to the hotel staff to replace their did films to media files
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
food was poor and staff very inexperienced
that every time i popped to reception no one was there i always had to call them to let them know i was in reception from my international number
the hotel is run down and in need of much loving tic  room as not cleaned to a satisfactory standard  staff on reception should honestly sharpen their customer service skill as they are the first face you see when you arrive  bar and restaurant are overpriced for what you get  but they know what they can get away with as the local restaurant are totally over the top
the security of personal belongings and the location
internet was only free near reception given the price of this hotel and the modern era should have wifi everywhere and shouldn have to pay extra the steps and floors can be slippery if it has been raining also not a fan of the wandering dogs either take plenty of insect repellent my legs and arms were covered in bites after the first night
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful
very very bad stuff not friendly very far rooms you should walk to the reception after breakfast to take a car to go your room when i want to order water in breakfast they told me go to and bring your water
staff were very helpful at all times they always went out of their way to assist us with all of our needs
the staff was very pleasant and also the food was were taste
the sea view staff very kindness clearness global except room glasses
the breakfast was really really good generally the atmosphere at the hotel was superb the staff were very helpful and friendly the room was super big and considering what we paid i really enjoyed the facilities were beyond expectations including the pool and food we came here for our honeymoon and would recommend this for couples
we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall
lack of english language by staff too many tourist come all staff she be speaking in  resort  need a life guard at the pools and stop kiss from jumping
check in early n checkout late was nightmare staff has high attitude on above topics
staff very helpful and going the extra mile

breakfast buffets was very good with a big choice and waiter service for the main course which meant that you receive warm eggs self service for extra like fresh fruit toast etc oh why can  hotels in thailand get faster masters nut the customer service lady  i think was exceptional she seemed to make a point of scurrying around at breakfast greeting guests and making sure they were happy and she always remembered my name my room was on the first floor and was well appointed and very comfortable beach at the hotel was well kept and clean plenty of sunbeam and a nice beach side bar good hotel with very good and pleasant staff and far enough away from chewing nighttime and noise to be able to get a good nights sleep
the staff are friendly they offered us free dinner to  apologize for ants in the room very good location
the staff
but the staff is good
loved the location  it is right at the end of fisherman village a true little boutique resort  our included breakfast was perfect every morning  everything was clean and the maid cleaned our room so quickly
the room was beautiful and very large with extra come beds the hotel is in a beautiful spot with lots of trees surrounding the property there is a free scuttle service that takes you to main supermarket and chewing the restaurant has a nice view by the sea the swimming pool is quite big and clean staff always very kind and ready to help breakfast has a large range of option and its generally good
excellent location peaceful loved our bungalow very clean staff were very attentive
overpriced nothing much and this is a strictly a cash business so dont think about paying your balance with your isa card  i had to walk to the cash machine and the staff graciously let me check in and pay the balance later i mean come one they say we only take isa and when i show them my isa card they pull that passive  aggressive that stuff ah ohhhi i i sorry i dont speak english  the room was poker and it had stairs so if you are traveling with young children you may consider this  the room was just ok far from town poker concrete and nothing special  the pool was small and the staff ok after i paid them in cash  there are two eating spots close by which are fair and tiny store which haswater  ok enough in glad i escaped
very good location great staff so so helpful manger is very helpful speaks good english so easy to talk to
staff was courteous practice and emphatic the food in buffets was fresh and appealing there were also more option provided in the hot and cold beverages compare to the other hotels the room was spacious and had all the amenities and moreover it was kept really clean and tidy for a lawless stay the sooty facility was available with the hotel  hence there was absolutely no need to submit your passport to the outside vendor overall complete value for money
excellent location friendly and helpful staff have just been enjoying my stay there
friendly staff nice little pool on chewing beach but slightly north and away from the busy beach
location was good most staff friendly king size bed
good location right on the beach and close to bars and restaurant friendly staff
this hotel is my absolute favourite the view of the beach is amazing it’s not too busy so you can enjoy the beach and hotel facilities without any haste the rooms are cleaned twice a day morning and evening with thoughtful added things like lighting a candle in the evening or leaving a fruit basket as a welcome ‘present’ the service is the best i received in thailand all members of staff are smile positive chatty and so welcoming they are always there to help you even before you realise you need help 🙂 absolutely impressed and would definitely go back
beautiful cabin with view of the sea and palm trees  very quiet and peaceful and very helpful staff good food
amazing woman in the reception extremely helpful with everything from giving us recommendations to helping us get a free transport to the pier do not miss the restaurant called brown sugar next to the entrance or the sunday market

the staff were very friendly and the hotel was situated in a nice place close to beach and shops
from our arrival at the reception where we were greeted by the lovely staff with such warmth and care till they day we left the experience was unforgettable throughout our stay it felt like being at home away from home
the staff were fantastic so helpful and kind i had everything i could need and more upgrade on arrival wonderful food a tailor on site to make a gorgeous dress in his pool and gardens are maintained all the time and trip around island was fun

wonderful luxury villas with private pools very friendly polite and helpful staff very much enjoyed our stay
a wonderfully relaxed break at this boutique hotel  staff were excellent and perhaps what makes this such a great place to stay  ideally located
the food was absolutely delicious and of very high quality english speaking staff gorgeous beach private to hotel residents and the water was calm enough to go swimming even during the month of august excellent facilities and activities on site there is so much to do and we didn feel the need to go elsewhere we loved the private gardens cycling and visiting the animal farm property and villas are so romantic hands down one of the best properties i have been to so far with my partner and worth every penny
i wish i would have booked a different hotel the staff were really great and had amazing massage ladies at the resort on the beach the beach itself was very nice and loved how you could get food and drinks delivered to you on they beach the price of the food and drinks were cheap and tasted amazing

it’s an amazing place well designed anantara style best breakfast buffets i’ve ever seen happy staff
hotel was absolutely amazing was right by the markets on friday nights and far enough away from the center so it want noisy at night the hotel was amazing the staff couldn do enough and the view from the rooftop pool was breathtaking perfect for a couple would go back without a doubt
very pleasant hotel beautiful room can say about the location we only stayed there to be close to the airport on our last night in oh same staff is incredibly nice and efficient though

fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the staff were fantastic the rooms and all facilities were very clean spacious and the resort was small so it never felt busy the pool was fantastic for everyone including kiss the swim up pool bar was always easy and happy hour in the afternoon was lovely the staff were always very helpful they had complimentary transfers to some reaches which was so easy especially with kiss would definitely stay again
great hotel on the beach traveling with kiss who enjoyed the fantastic swimming pool close to everything staff very friendly and helpful clean neat rooms
staff especially data were great perfect location sea service and pool fantastic
good location can get an open back taxi to main strip rooms nice cleaned every day good size to staff are very friendly good pool area
our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
it was great that the kalb same was able to generally cater to dietary requirements such as vegetarian and glutenfree the rooms had lovely views were clean and spacious and the property in general was simple modern clean and beautiful the staff were polite and helpful
the staff were just lovely so very helpfulthe room was beautiful we stayed in the lamp suite and it was spacious and clean
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
very nice staff
the wonderful staff were so friendly and helpful
the room restaurant and pool is excellent manager and staff are super friendly
very helpful staff
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
this was a nice property the pool was very clean and staff were great we liked our villa a lot
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
pillow and other staff at bed was horrible
breakfast staff and coffee quality
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
one of the mornings breakfast was slow and staff didn have enough english
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
staff are less friendly  everything we asked we have got no answer  room was big but the air con  was not working even
the communication between the staff can be better we asked a few times for some drinks in our room and after the th time they finally brought us the drinks unfortantly it was half what we ordered
had a mouse in my room when i told them at the reception they said oh did she come back again  so they apparently knew it and still rented the room out one of the worst experiences i ever had
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
horrible smell come through reception and restaurant
the swimming pool bar staff and return transfer driver didn seem to be in a good mood that the only tiny pity part
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
you have to ask the staff to get food on the buffets its not great as well
staff doesn speak good english
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
after we took our meals from the breakfast open buffets we saw a huge insect in our plate it was dead and covered with sauce obviously cooked with the past it was not a nice experience we called he staff and they removed the paget from the buffets  helene conditions could be improved
for sum reason the white wine is very expensive this is not a dislike but have suggested to the hotel staff to replace their did films to media files
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
food was poor and staff very inexperienced
that every time i popped to reception no one was there i always had to call them to let them know i was in reception from my international number
the hotel is run down and in need of much loving tic  room as not cleaned to a satisfactory standard  staff on reception should honestly sharpen their customer service skill as they are the first face you see when you arrive  bar and restaurant are overpriced for what you get  but they know what they can get away with as the local restaurant are totally over the top
the security of personal belongings and the location
internet was only free near reception given the price of this hotel and the modern era should have wifi everywhere and shouldn have to pay extra the steps and floors can be slippery if it has been raining also not a fan of the wandering dogs either take plenty of insect repellent my legs and arms were covered in bites after the first night
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful
very very bad stuff not friendly very far rooms you should walk to the reception after breakfast to take a car to go your room when i want to order water in breakfast they told me go to and bring your water
staff were very helpful at all times they always went out of their way to assist us with all of our needs
the staff was very pleasant and also the food was were taste
the sea view staff very kindness clearness global except room glasses
the breakfast was really really good generally the atmosphere at the hotel was superb the staff were very helpful and friendly the room was super big and considering what we paid i really enjoyed the facilities were beyond expectations including the pool and food we came here for our honeymoon and would recommend this for couples
we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall
lack of english language by staff too many tourist come all staff she be speaking in  resort  need a life guard at the pools and stop kiss from jumping
check in early n checkout late was nightmare staff has high attitude on above topics
staff very helpful and going the extra mile
customer service from the reception desk was not in keeping with the rest of the hotel
a lot of rooms were too far from the breakfast area and the walk back to the  room was very firing the golf car service was only available from the reception and not from the breakfast area the climb is too firing
staff
staff in the reception was trying to charge me more money for a taxi then actual cost its a big shame that hotel staff are thinking how to screw their guests
staff
okay experience  staff not very courteous
the cleaning lady was very attentive and very pleasant as were the all the breakfast staff the front desk staff were very cheerful and helpful
we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant on the last night and it was delicious the pool was very nice and clean and the staff were wonderful
the character of the hotel is fabulous the staff warm professional and friendly the food great and the situation the prime location on the chewing mon beachfronti would have rate the hotel  based on my very first impression but i have to say it grew on me splash of cash at least  years overdue
beautiful rooms set back in nature lovely pool staff and service greatly enjoyed our penthouse suite with amazing views perfect for a romantic gateway staff was so friendly and helpful we will be back again soon
absolutely great staff even when we came back from another island and needed them to book us a taxi and we needed a quick swim they were available and we were no longer checked in says clot  really great place and great location
was excited to come back for my second year and for that new year and songkran unfortunately it was not the same as last year it was so dead the little outside canada was ruined and unstable the pool was constantly full of bags there is no outside drinks allowed and with it being new year we wanted a little while to chill and hangout before the water fights and the only drinks available where changes and breeze and they were very over prices but it does state they have bucket but unfortunately while we were there the want any actually available with it being so quite i hoped to get a sooner for rent and they didn have any left the girl at the front said so we had to go to the same pier to rent one i went with my fiance and didn stop talking about the place until we got there as i was so excited because of my wonderful stay last year we got two single beds instead of a queen or king so we had to push our beds together i will say the staff is still amazing the beds and pillows comfortable
staff always smile and friendly
the room was lovely and the view from the balcony i was in the sunrise jacuzzi room was amazing the staff were all very helpful and friendly and the location is great  on the quieter end of chewing beach but still close to the action
the location of the hotel was lovely all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially the lady at reception the food was good and i liked the fact they had a different promotion every evening overall i will highly recommend to anyone going to visit oh same
peaceful location  staff were very friendly  room was huge  minimal was reasonably prices  nice pool  sea massage was really good
quiet yet next to fisherman village service staff venue beach and pool all great
this is our second time here we enjoyed absolutely everything the private beach is just a dream very clean sand and water not many people service is on high level and restraints are very good quality and prices are realistic resort’s staff is very friendly some of them are working for many years here was glad to see them beautiful nature around very good to have evening promenades the rooms are very clean and comfortable i really liked the idea of using bamboo straw for all drinks myself and my husband initially divided our trip into two hotels as we were staying in same for  days so after tongs bay we went to intercontinental hotel but we were disappointed by their beach and dirty neighborhood and next day returned back to our favorite tongs bay
transport was readily available breakfast was lovely staff were very very friendly and helpful  was really nice of the manager to show us around cleaning staff bar and restaurant staff and even staff at reception always greeted us with a smilebrilliant facilities pictures probably don’t do this place justice it’s really beautiful the rooms are emasculate

staff was courteous practice and emphatic the food in buffets was fresh and appealing there were also more option provided in the hot and cold beverages compare to the other hotels the room was spacious and had all the amenities and moreover it was kept really clean and tidy for a lawless stay the sooty facility was available with the hotel  hence there was absolutely no need to submit your passport to the outside vendor overall complete value for money
excellent location friendly and helpful staff have just been enjoying my stay there
friendly staff nice little pool on chewing beach but slightly north and away from the busy beach
location was good most staff friendly king size bed
good location right on the beach and close to bars and restaurant friendly staff
this hotel is my absolute favourite the view of the beach is amazing it’s not too busy so you can enjoy the beach and hotel facilities without any haste the rooms are cleaned twice a day morning and evening with thoughtful added things like lighting a candle in the evening or leaving a fruit basket as a welcome ‘present’ the service is the best i received in thailand all members of staff are smile positive chatty and so welcoming they are always there to help you even before you realise you need help 🙂 absolutely impressed and would definitely go back
beautiful cabin with view of the sea and palm trees  very quiet and peaceful and very helpful staff good food

fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the staff were fantastic the rooms and all facilities were very clean spacious and the resort was small so it never felt busy the pool was fantastic for everyone including kiss the swim up pool bar was always easy and happy hour in the afternoon was lovely the staff were always very helpful they had complimentary transfers to some reaches which was so easy especially with kiss would definitely stay again
great hotel on the beach traveling with kiss who enjoyed the fantastic swimming pool close to everything staff very friendly and helpful clean neat rooms

our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
it was great that the kalb same was able to generally cater to dietary requirements such as vegetarian and glutenfree the rooms had lovely views were clean and spacious and the property in general was simple modern clean and beautiful the staff were polite and helpful

great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
very nice staff
the wonderful staff were so friendly and helpful
the room restaurant and pool is excellent manager and staff are super friendly
very helpful staff
clean lovely pools friendly staff  delicious food
this was a nice property the pool was very clean and staff were great we liked our villa a lot
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
pillow and other staff at bed was horrible
breakfast staff and coffee quality
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service
one of the mornings breakfast was slow and staff didn have enough english
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
staff are less friendly  everything we asked we have got no answer  room was big but the air con  was not working even
the communication between the staff can be better we asked a few times for some drinks in our room and after the th time they finally brought us the drinks unfortantly it was half what we ordered
had a mouse in my room when i told them at the reception they said oh did she come back again  so they apparently knew it and still rented the room out one of the worst experiences i ever had
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
horrible smell come through reception and restaurant
the swimming pool bar staff and return transfer driver didn seem to be in a good mood that the only tiny pity part
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
you have to ask the staff to get food on the buffets its not great as well
staff doesn speak good english
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes
after we took our meals from the breakfast open buffets we saw a huge insect in our plate it was dead and covered with sauce obviously cooked with the past it was not a nice experience we called he staff and they removed the paget from the buffets  helene conditions could be improved
for sum reason the white wine is very expensive this is not a dislike but have suggested to the hotel staff to replace their did films to media files
my room smelled of cigarettes when i first arrived there was work being done nearby my room and no one told me that there would be drilling that i could hear during the day on my arrival the internet didn work and i was told that an engineer would come and fix it which he didn i called reception three times to get this resolved and it want my dishes weren taken from my room when i ordered room service also everything in the resort is twice as expensive this includes massage and food
food was poor and staff very inexperienced
that every time i popped to reception no one was there i always had to call them to let them know i was in reception from my international number
the hotel is run down and in need of much loving tic  room as not cleaned to a satisfactory standard  staff on reception should honestly sharpen their customer service skill as they are the first face you see when you arrive  bar and restaurant are overpriced for what you get  but they know what they can get away with as the local restaurant are totally over the top
the security of personal belongings and the location
internet was only free near reception given the price of this hotel and the modern era should have wifi everywhere and shouldn have to pay extra the steps and floors can be slippery if it has been raining also not a fan of the wandering dogs either take plenty of insect repellent my legs and arms were covered in bites after the first night
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful

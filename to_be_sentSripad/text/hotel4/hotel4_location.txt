really bad costume service we had  rooms and couldn’t get even one for early check in despite the fact that all the rooms were ready but they kept us waiting till pm as its their check in time and even after that took them  min to give us our rooms i ask them couple of times if we could get least one of our rooms  hour early as my wife was pregnant and she wanted to rest but they refused and said we all had to wait till pm which is not expected from a star resort and when we got to our rooms it was really hot and the air con was off the checking out time is really early at am and dont expect to get a late check out in room dining service is till pm which is a really weak point for the hotel as the nearest place to get something is  min drive or min walk
location noise of airplane
location
we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall
the photo are totally accurate of the hillside pool villa it really was the most spectacular view and a beautiful place to spend the first week of our honeymoon
a lot of rooms were too far from the breakfast area and the walk back to the  room was very firing the golf car service was only available from the reception and not from the breakfast area the climb is too firing
the architectural and artistic theme was good pleasant feel to the place
the hotel was generally very nice layout of the location was compact but comfortable
location is good valuable to the main attraction of conan
cut little huts good area and so close to the beach
super cheap and a great location the room got a little hot at times and the facilities were basic but we knew this at the time of booking and is why the price is so good a great little stop off for a budget stay
more or less private beach nice quiet location clean tidy nice gardens and pool
the place is fantastic comfort living and nice environment
great location near the beach but off of the main road so not noisy during the night modern and clean rooms
the character of the hotel is fabulous the staff warm professional and friendly the food great and the situation the prime location on the chewing mon beachfronti would have rate the hotel  based on my very first impression but i have to say it grew on me splash of cash at least  years overdue
absolutely great staff even when we came back from another island and needed them to book us a taxi and we needed a quick swim they were available and we were no longer checked in says clot  really great place and great location
the location right on the beach
was excited to come back for my second year and for that new year and songkran unfortunately it was not the same as last year it was so dead the little outside canada was ruined and unstable the pool was constantly full of bags there is no outside drinks allowed and with it being new year we wanted a little while to chill and hangout before the water fights and the only drinks available where changes and breeze and they were very over prices but it does state they have bucket but unfortunately while we were there the want any actually available with it being so quite i hoped to get a sooner for rent and they didn have any left the girl at the front said so we had to go to the same pier to rent one i went with my fiance and didn stop talking about the place until we got there as i was so excited because of my wonderful stay last year we got two single beds instead of a queen or king so we had to push our beds together i will say the staff is still amazing the beds and pillows comfortable
the room was lovely and the view from the balcony i was in the sunrise jacuzzi room was amazing the staff were all very helpful and friendly and the location is great  on the quieter end of chewing beach but still close to the action
the location of the hotel was lovely all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially the lady at reception the food was good and i liked the fact they had a different promotion every evening overall i will highly recommend to anyone going to visit oh same
peaceful location  staff were very friendly  room was huge  minimal was reasonably prices  nice pool  sea massage was really good
quiet yet next to fisherman village service staff venue beach and pool all great
this is our second time here we enjoyed absolutely everything the private beach is just a dream very clean sand and water not many people service is on high level and restraints are very good quality and prices are realistic resort’s staff is very friendly some of them are working for many years here was glad to see them beautiful nature around very good to have evening promenades the rooms are very clean and comfortable i really liked the idea of using bamboo straw for all drinks myself and my husband initially divided our trip into two hotels as we were staying in same for  days so after tongs bay we went to intercontinental hotel but we were disappointed by their beach and dirty neighborhood and next day returned back to our favorite tongs bay
we recommend this place for those who really want to have very quite and private holidays with high quality service and enjoy private beach
transport was readily available breakfast was lovely staff were very very friendly and helpful  was really nice of the manager to show us around cleaning staff bar and restaurant staff and even staff at reception always greeted us with a smilebrilliant facilities pictures probably don’t do this place justice it’s really beautiful the rooms are emasculate
the best place for vacation at simon

the food at the restaurant attached is stunning good value and well worth a visit even if your not staying here its a good location for everything right on the beach
peaceful location with beautiful views
nice and clean room friendly staff nice location and very close to the beach
we were only there a couple of nights but if we were there for longer we would have rented a motorbike one place down the road rents from  bath a day and that would have solved the hill issue at the same time if you are looking for a romantic and relaxed gateway and prefer a more secluded location this resort is perfect
amazing place so beautiful and quiet exactly what we wanted stay here
amazing stay i stayed for  nights and can hardly find a fault with weimar the resort is stylish and tranquil with a fabulous pool with a swim up bar and happy hour everyday to enjoy all the delicious cocktail they have to offer the food in the restaurant was great  we particularly enjoyed the saturday night by where we had amazing speak and pawns while listening to a very talented live musician one of the highlight of our stay the clientele is mostly young couples giving the place a very calm and relaxed vice we didn’t try any of the activities offered but there would be lots to do for anyone looking for a more active stay especially for those interested in exercise and you overall a wonderful stay and one of the best hotels i have visited
good location close to the beach bars and shops
it is a heavenly spot fine arrangement excellent pool we go to this hotel annually service and personnel this time has especially surprised numbers are washed to gloss cleaning daily water paper towels  everything is bungalows process means from insects  there are no ants even thanks to managers of hotel and to personnel for the fact that so watch hotel

the staff are really helpful and friendly the french lady at the reception helped us make our trip great the property is located in a quite side of oh same however food was never a problem as there are many good beach side restaurant around the property  definitely i will recommend this place to a friend
the staff were very friendly and the hotel was situated in a nice place close to beach and shops
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
overall we liked the hotel it is new and modern room and bathroom was really big were got the pool view room with a nice terrace which was nice the best part of the hotel is the pool area  i have never seen such a huge pool grm is well equipped as well
lovely private pool beautiful location serenity  huge come bed
the anantara lawn is ideally located with a short taxi ride to the downtown area taxes are available at all times there is a little convenient store just opposite which was extremely handy for midnight craving the resort arranged a car for us and that made seeing the entire island very easy oh they offered maggie services for guests to move around the resort that was ideal for the lazy person i am
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
the property was amazing  we received a free upgrade from a poolside to a villa poolside apartment which was very spacious  the location was very quiet and enabled us a spectacular view to the sea the food was great fresh fruit cake or biscuits were freely provided daily the staff were awesome entertainment provided both day and night so you didn’t need to go venture out we felt well pampered on our last day we enjoyed a couples full body massage it was our first time having this that treatment a super end to our holiday  we will definitely be visiting again
clean peaceful place staff is good
the location is very good
the hotel was just amazing such a beautiful place and right on the beach
a wonderfully relaxed break at this boutique hotel  staff were excellent and perhaps what makes this such a great place to stay  ideally located
great hospitality excellent location
great location nice beach and exceptional absence throughout the resort friendly welcoming manager and staff swasana massage is a must
direct access to nice beach and large beach bed area big swimming pool next to the beach nice foodbar service at the beach  pool spacious rooms nice massage sea
the hotel staff were amazing  they went above and beyond to even send a complimentary cake and sing me happy birthday  the whiteness of the beach area as its not crowded  great time getting massage on the beach
very nice and good place
pleasant staff decent rooms good breakfast great location
very clean and friendly staff resort is in a perfect location very central
the rooms are so big and comfortable the staff are amazing and so helpful i like their food as well and beach is incredible  its a quiet place and good for relaxing
the place the view the beach is quiet and beautiful the that restaurant is good people are very pleasant
travelled with family during this month and we booked deluge room at first we were greeted by very courteous staff and well informed in our room after the checking timothy room is very clean and spacious unlike what other people write on the reviews saying its dirty cleaning is done everyday including changing of bedsheets and pillow sheets rooms service can be ordered until  pm and breakfast everyday was surprisingly enough and lots of variation its delirious specially my favorite wattle can also order vegetarian food just need to inform the staffs were entertained by dandy who very attentive in our needs service with a smile as always since we are vegetarian dandy helped us in every way he never gets tired whatever we need as well as to other guest once called by his name well known for his being so friendly as i guests encountered some ac problem but it was solved immediately after being told to fix and they are very apologetic the fact it occurs one takeover all our holiday was perfect and the best  since bring staffs and management are all very helpful to make our family holiday the way we wanted we even got a free transfer to airport arranged by dandy thank you to mr thaippine days boss as he always said😊👍 thank you the bring management and we will definitely comeback with our friend as we already advertised it to all of our friends in indian must visited than other hotel which is expensive worth the value as i can say missing the place now and had a lovely memory with dandy from philippines for being so hospitable and taking care of us specially my   yes old daughter misha
aah what a lovely place this is right off the main street and close to the beach supermarket and restaurant all around the ladies here are so nice and helpful the room is fabulous and super clean i enjoyed my stay here clot
it’s an amazing place well designed anantara style best breakfast buffets i’ve ever seen happy staff
very pleasant hotel beautiful room can say about the location we only stayed there to be close to the airport on our last night in oh same staff is incredibly nice and efficient though
the location
was really good location was perfect staff amazing
bout area seems to be one of the nicest parts of same within it the peace resort felt like an oasis of calm and quality enough facilities breakfast receptionists sunbeam etc for all guests even in busy season
location was good
staff was nicegreat location although a little bit noisy at night can blame the hotel for this its nor their faultroom was clean bed very comfortable and bathroom was nice
pool and bar location with daubed next to beach allows access to all these highlight at a stone’s throw
room  we had a pool vilna it’s great feels like real relaxing place for the family
fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the location was incredible  the value for the location is a steal  the food was a good price and the service was great and the food was average but very good for the price
excellent location with a short walk to the main strip of shops
the breakfast and location were ok
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest   they replied very fast are easy to find and the pool is nice the rooms are cheap so do not expect  star luxury they let me rent the sooner an additional day even though we had to check out because the hotel was booked out otherwise we would have stayed longer
right on the beach and also in a good location for the bars and entertainment
it’s location was amazing shops bars restaurant etc were only walking distance from the place
it is a good location of you want to be near the airport fro an early morning flight
staff especially data were great perfect location sea service and pool fantastic
good location can get an open back taxi to main strip rooms nice cleaned every day good size to staff are very friendly good pool area
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
good location spacious rooms
our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
location and facilities were fine but the wifi was poor
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
perfect locationclose to the beach great breakfastgood internet nice pool hotel has everything you need great deal for the money you pay stuff upgrade us from standard room to superior room loved everything about this place
nice location direct on the beach nice restaurant
great location
the location is fantastic just a walk to the beach and also very near to the main markets
small pool area we didn’t struggle to get a bed and it wasn’t crowded but i imagine in high season it is far too small for the number of rooms they have no lift for guests found it sufficient especially as it was included in our room price which was very cheap anyway but there was very little choice at the breakfast buffets
the place was just below an acceptable level of cleanliness the bathroom is small and basic i like a firm bed but this was like sleeping on a sooner table didn find it as noisy at night as people suggest though
there is only  mirror for use which is in the bathroom hence if someone is using the bathroom you cannot use a mirror  i would recommend a mirror in the main room as well plus the bathroom being a open area becomes too hot in summer i would recommend a fan in the bathroom
it has potential to be a lovely resort but the gardens and pool area need a good overhauled as there was debris and leaves rubbish cardboard from new years eve celebrations lying around down by the loungers which were wooden with no fashioning my back was breaking after lying on it
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
location was a bit secluded but if your going for a relaxing break its perfect
perhaps a little attention to the pool area its a little tiredifferent
shells in the bathroom dusty and rusty bad smell of suffer and humidity hairdryer was burnt air conditioning too loud after we complained we got another room with pleasant smell but still this place needs a takeover
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year
some noise during morning hours due to location
the whole place needs maintenance bad smell from the toilet
each morning someone from guest services would walk through the breakfast area approaching people and ask them about their stay leaving date and so forth this was fine but it was a little irritating having stop eating mid breakfast to have a chat with them each day although we were only there for  days its nice they make the effort to engage with guests and make sure everything is ok so its not a big criticism but we just didn like it
location is poor as you have to take a taxi to the beach not with in walking distance from the hotel
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
no hot water and everything is very expensive in the restaurant without any reason  one place near the hotel served better food with better atmosphere and with  less price
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
food was good but a bit costly location was a bit too far from everything
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
leaving this wonderful place called tongs bay
chewing beach was very littered with rubbish even if the hotel cleaned the area in front of the hotel the rest of the beach is just bad it is a shame that there are not people cleaning the beach every day as that will make a big impact chewing also becoming a lot like among in pocket where there are shops clubs everywhere some will like this and others wont some maintenance also required for the wood flooring in the rooms but i can imagine visitors with wet feet will create this constantly
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
the restaurant venue is very limited
closed early very quiet after pm around the pool and bar area
bathroom is nice and clean but isn have many danger and i dont like the way they put shower and toilet in the same place would be better if they have shower curtain
hotel taxi service is too expensive scuttle to nearest market area would be very helpful
the breakfast was soto and could be improved a bit area is very tourist but that chewing and to be expected bathroom was steaming hot as it has open windows and ac doesn work for the bathroom
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
the area behind the resort is not very appealing the bar and restaurant are a little over prices
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable
the security of personal belongings and the location
the dining area could have been made more attractive and brighter at night   the gloominess could have led most guests to eat elsewhere at night compared to the numbers at breakfast
impracticable due to the locking of ferries the pool would be ideal for children if they respected the heights the value for money is indecent the same type of structure can be found below the half price  in general i do not recommend it to anyone the worst place of same
the place is very noisy
really bad costume service we had  rooms and couldn’t get even one for early check in despite the fact that all the rooms were ready but they kept us waiting till pm as its their check in time and even after that took them  min to give us our rooms i ask them couple of times if we could get least one of our rooms  hour early as my wife was pregnant and she wanted to rest but they refused and said we all had to wait till pm which is not expected from a star resort and when we got to our rooms it was really hot and the air con was off the checking out time is really early at am and dont expect to get a late check out in room dining service is till pm which is a really weak point for the hotel as the nearest place to get something is  min drive or min walk
location noise of airplane

we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall

we were only there a couple of nights but if we were there for longer we would have rented a motorbike one place down the road rents from  bath a day and that would have solved the hill issue at the same time if you are looking for a romantic and relaxed gateway and prefer a more secluded location this resort is perfect
amazing place so beautiful and quiet exactly what we wanted stay here
amazing stay i stayed for  nights and can hardly find a fault with weimar the resort is stylish and tranquil with a fabulous pool with a swim up bar and happy hour everyday to enjoy all the delicious cocktail they have to offer the food in the restaurant was great  we particularly enjoyed the saturday night by where we had amazing speak and pawns while listening to a very talented live musician one of the highlight of our stay the clientele is mostly young couples giving the place a very calm and relaxed vice we didn’t try any of the activities offered but there would be lots to do for anyone looking for a more active stay especially for those interested in exercise and you overall a wonderful stay and one of the best hotels i have visited

the staff were very friendly and the hotel was situated in a nice place close to beach and shops
beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
overall we liked the hotel it is new and modern room and bathroom was really big were got the pool view room with a nice terrace which was nice the best part of the hotel is the pool area  i have never seen such a huge pool grm is well equipped as well
lovely private pool beautiful location serenity  huge come bed
the anantara lawn is ideally located with a short taxi ride to the downtown area taxes are available at all times there is a little convenient store just opposite which was extremely handy for midnight craving the resort arranged a car for us and that made seeing the entire island very easy oh they offered maggie services for guests to move around the resort that was ideal for the lazy person i am
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
the property was amazing  we received a free upgrade from a poolside to a villa poolside apartment which was very spacious  the location was very quiet and enabled us a spectacular view to the sea the food was great fresh fruit cake or biscuits were freely provided daily the staff were awesome entertainment provided both day and night so you didn’t need to go venture out we felt well pampered on our last day we enjoyed a couples full body massage it was our first time having this that treatment a super end to our holiday  we will definitely be visiting again
clean peaceful place staff is good
the location is very good
the hotel was just amazing such a beautiful place and right on the beach
a wonderfully relaxed break at this boutique hotel  staff were excellent and perhaps what makes this such a great place to stay  ideally located
great hospitality excellent location

direct access to nice beach and large beach bed area big swimming pool next to the beach nice foodbar service at the beach  pool spacious rooms nice massage sea

very clean and friendly staff resort is in a perfect location very central
the rooms are so big and comfortable the staff are amazing and so helpful i like their food as well and beach is incredible  its a quiet place and good for relaxing
the place the view the beach is quiet and beautiful the that restaurant is good people are very pleasant
travelled with family during this month and we booked deluge room at first we were greeted by very courteous staff and well informed in our room after the checking timothy room is very clean and spacious unlike what other people write on the reviews saying its dirty cleaning is done everyday including changing of bedsheets and pillow sheets rooms service can be ordered until  pm and breakfast everyday was surprisingly enough and lots of variation its delirious specially my favorite wattle can also order vegetarian food just need to inform the staffs were entertained by dandy who very attentive in our needs service with a smile as always since we are vegetarian dandy helped us in every way he never gets tired whatever we need as well as to other guest once called by his name well known for his being so friendly as i guests encountered some ac problem but it was solved immediately after being told to fix and they are very apologetic the fact it occurs one takeover all our holiday was perfect and the best  since bring staffs and management are all very helpful to make our family holiday the way we wanted we even got a free transfer to airport arranged by dandy thank you to mr thaippine days boss as he always said😊👍 thank you the bring management and we will definitely comeback with our friend as we already advertised it to all of our friends in indian must visited than other hotel which is expensive worth the value as i can say missing the place now and had a lovely memory with dandy from philippines for being so hospitable and taking care of us specially my   yes old daughter misha
aah what a lovely place this is right off the main street and close to the beach supermarket and restaurant all around the ladies here are so nice and helpful the room is fabulous and super clean i enjoyed my stay here clot
it’s an amazing place well designed anantara style best breakfast buffets i’ve ever seen happy staff
very pleasant hotel beautiful room can say about the location we only stayed there to be close to the airport on our last night in oh same staff is incredibly nice and efficient though
the location
was really good location was perfect staff amazing
bout area seems to be one of the nicest parts of same within it the peace resort felt like an oasis of calm and quality enough facilities breakfast receptionists sunbeam etc for all guests even in busy season
location was good
staff was nicegreat location although a little bit noisy at night can blame the hotel for this its nor their faultroom was clean bed very comfortable and bathroom was nice
pool and bar location with daubed next to beach allows access to all these highlight at a stone’s throw
room  we had a pool vilna it’s great feels like real relaxing place for the family
fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the location was incredible  the value for the location is a steal  the food was a good price and the service was great and the food was average but very good for the price
excellent location with a short walk to the main strip of shops
the breakfast and location were ok
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest   they replied very fast are easy to find and the pool is nice the rooms are cheap so do not expect  star luxury they let me rent the sooner an additional day even though we had to check out because the hotel was booked out otherwise we would have stayed longer
right on the beach and also in a good location for the bars and entertainment
it’s location was amazing shops bars restaurant etc were only walking distance from the place
it is a good location of you want to be near the airport fro an early morning flight
staff especially data were great perfect location sea service and pool fantastic
good location can get an open back taxi to main strip rooms nice cleaned every day good size to staff are very friendly good pool area
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
good location spacious rooms
our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
location and facilities were fine but the wifi was poor
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
perfect locationclose to the beach great breakfastgood internet nice pool hotel has everything you need great deal for the money you pay stuff upgrade us from standard room to superior room loved everything about this place
nice location direct on the beach nice restaurant
great location
the location is fantastic just a walk to the beach and also very near to the main markets
small pool area we didn’t struggle to get a bed and it wasn’t crowded but i imagine in high season it is far too small for the number of rooms they have no lift for guests found it sufficient especially as it was included in our room price which was very cheap anyway but there was very little choice at the breakfast buffets
the place was just below an acceptable level of cleanliness the bathroom is small and basic i like a firm bed but this was like sleeping on a sooner table didn find it as noisy at night as people suggest though
there is only  mirror for use which is in the bathroom hence if someone is using the bathroom you cannot use a mirror  i would recommend a mirror in the main room as well plus the bathroom being a open area becomes too hot in summer i would recommend a fan in the bathroom
it has potential to be a lovely resort but the gardens and pool area need a good overhauled as there was debris and leaves rubbish cardboard from new years eve celebrations lying around down by the loungers which were wooden with no fashioning my back was breaking after lying on it
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
location was a bit secluded but if your going for a relaxing break its perfect
perhaps a little attention to the pool area its a little tiredifferent
shells in the bathroom dusty and rusty bad smell of suffer and humidity hairdryer was burnt air conditioning too loud after we complained we got another room with pleasant smell but still this place needs a takeover
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year
some noise during morning hours due to location
the whole place needs maintenance bad smell from the toilet
each morning someone from guest services would walk through the breakfast area approaching people and ask them about their stay leaving date and so forth this was fine but it was a little irritating having stop eating mid breakfast to have a chat with them each day although we were only there for  days its nice they make the effort to engage with guests and make sure everything is ok so its not a big criticism but we just didn like it
location is poor as you have to take a taxi to the beach not with in walking distance from the hotel
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
no hot water and everything is very expensive in the restaurant without any reason  one place near the hotel served better food with better atmosphere and with  less price
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
food was good but a bit costly location was a bit too far from everything
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
leaving this wonderful place called tongs bay
chewing beach was very littered with rubbish even if the hotel cleaned the area in front of the hotel the rest of the beach is just bad it is a shame that there are not people cleaning the beach every day as that will make a big impact chewing also becoming a lot like among in pocket where there are shops clubs everywhere some will like this and others wont some maintenance also required for the wood flooring in the rooms but i can imagine visitors with wet feet will create this constantly
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
the restaurant venue is very limited
closed early very quiet after pm around the pool and bar area
bathroom is nice and clean but isn have many danger and i dont like the way they put shower and toilet in the same place would be better if they have shower curtain
hotel taxi service is too expensive scuttle to nearest market area would be very helpful
the breakfast was soto and could be improved a bit area is very tourist but that chewing and to be expected bathroom was steaming hot as it has open windows and ac doesn work for the bathroom
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
the area behind the resort is not very appealing the bar and restaurant are a little over prices
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable
the security of personal belongings and the location
the dining area could have been made more attractive and brighter at night   the gloominess could have led most guests to eat elsewhere at night compared to the numbers at breakfast
impracticable due to the locking of ferries the pool would be ideal for children if they respected the heights the value for money is indecent the same type of structure can be found below the half price  in general i do not recommend it to anyone the worst place of same
the place is very noisy
really bad costume service we had  rooms and couldn’t get even one for early check in despite the fact that all the rooms were ready but they kept us waiting till pm as its their check in time and even after that took them  min to give us our rooms i ask them couple of times if we could get least one of our rooms  hour early as my wife was pregnant and she wanted to rest but they refused and said we all had to wait till pm which is not expected from a star resort and when we got to our rooms it was really hot and the air con was off the checking out time is really early at am and dont expect to get a late check out in room dining service is till pm which is a really weak point for the hotel as the nearest place to get something is  min drive or min walk
location noise of airplane
location
we stayed here for  nights for a friends wedding and could not fault the hotel the staff were extremely courteous and the roomshotel were exceptionally well presented the location was also beautiful the breakfast was delicious everyday and pool bar was awesome although a little more expensive that can be found in town if you are considering getting married here i would definitely suggest you put it top of your list overall
the photo are totally accurate of the hillside pool villa it really was the most spectacular view and a beautiful place to spend the first week of our honeymoon
a lot of rooms were too far from the breakfast area and the walk back to the  room was very firing the golf car service was only available from the reception and not from the breakfast area the climb is too firing
the architectural and artistic theme was good pleasant feel to the place
the hotel was generally very nice layout of the location was compact but comfortable
location is good valuable to the main attraction of conan
cut little huts good area and so close to the beach
super cheap and a great location the room got a little hot at times and the facilities were basic but we knew this at the time of booking and is why the price is so good a great little stop off for a budget stay
more or less private beach nice quiet location clean tidy nice gardens and pool
the place is fantastic comfort living and nice environment
great location near the beach but off of the main road so not noisy during the night modern and clean rooms
the character of the hotel is fabulous the staff warm professional and friendly the food great and the situation the prime location on the chewing mon beachfronti would have rate the hotel  based on my very first impression but i have to say it grew on me splash of cash at least  years overdue
absolutely great staff even when we came back from another island and needed them to book us a taxi and we needed a quick swim they were available and we were no longer checked in says clot  really great place and great location
the location right on the beach
was excited to come back for my second year and for that new year and songkran unfortunately it was not the same as last year it was so dead the little outside canada was ruined and unstable the pool was constantly full of bags there is no outside drinks allowed and with it being new year we wanted a little while to chill and hangout before the water fights and the only drinks available where changes and breeze and they were very over prices but it does state they have bucket but unfortunately while we were there the want any actually available with it being so quite i hoped to get a sooner for rent and they didn have any left the girl at the front said so we had to go to the same pier to rent one i went with my fiance and didn stop talking about the place until we got there as i was so excited because of my wonderful stay last year we got two single beds instead of a queen or king so we had to push our beds together i will say the staff is still amazing the beds and pillows comfortable
the room was lovely and the view from the balcony i was in the sunrise jacuzzi room was amazing the staff were all very helpful and friendly and the location is great  on the quieter end of chewing beach but still close to the action
the location of the hotel was lovely all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful especially the lady at reception the food was good and i liked the fact they had a different promotion every evening overall i will highly recommend to anyone going to visit oh same
peaceful location  staff were very friendly  room was huge  minimal was reasonably prices  nice pool  sea massage was really good
quiet yet next to fisherman village service staff venue beach and pool all great
this is our second time here we enjoyed absolutely everything the private beach is just a dream very clean sand and water not many people service is on high level and restraints are very good quality and prices are realistic resort’s staff is very friendly some of them are working for many years here was glad to see them beautiful nature around very good to have evening promenades the rooms are very clean and comfortable i really liked the idea of using bamboo straw for all drinks myself and my husband initially divided our trip into two hotels as we were staying in same for  days so after tongs bay we went to intercontinental hotel but we were disappointed by their beach and dirty neighborhood and next day returned back to our favorite tongs bay
we recommend this place for those who really want to have very quite and private holidays with high quality service and enjoy private beach
transport was readily available breakfast was lovely staff were very very friendly and helpful  was really nice of the manager to show us around cleaning staff bar and restaurant staff and even staff at reception always greeted us with a smilebrilliant facilities pictures probably don’t do this place justice it’s really beautiful the rooms are emasculate
the best place for vacation at simon
great location right off main strip quiet spacious and clean room very sweet staff
we preferred the kalb hotel for our honeymoon was great hotel the located in silence area a bit far from center but view was amazing and you will be able to listen sea’s voice  i checked more then  hotels in same lovely stuff they are always smiling breakfast was also obey and at our last day we changed our room to pool villa  all included  lunch and dinner was perfect

beautiful hotel with an awesome location not in the chawenf but by the fisherman per which was awesome
overall we liked the hotel it is new and modern room and bathroom was really big were got the pool view room with a nice terrace which was nice the best part of the hotel is the pool area  i have never seen such a huge pool grm is well equipped as well
lovely private pool beautiful location serenity  huge come bed
the anantara lawn is ideally located with a short taxi ride to the downtown area taxes are available at all times there is a little convenient store just opposite which was extremely handy for midnight craving the resort arranged a car for us and that made seeing the entire island very easy oh they offered maggie services for guests to move around the resort that was ideal for the lazy person i am
the hotel room was a decent size and had an amazing bathroom and a big to the location of the hotel is probably the best thing about it it is also great fun as there is a do on everyday and there is also a nice vice make sure you get breakfast there too as it is really nice
the property was amazing  we received a free upgrade from a poolside to a villa poolside apartment which was very spacious  the location was very quiet and enabled us a spectacular view to the sea the food was great fresh fruit cake or biscuits were freely provided daily the staff were awesome entertainment provided both day and night so you didn’t need to go venture out we felt well pampered on our last day we enjoyed a couples full body massage it was our first time having this that treatment a super end to our holiday  we will definitely be visiting again

aah what a lovely place this is right off the main street and close to the beach supermarket and restaurant all around the ladies here are so nice and helpful the room is fabulous and super clean i enjoyed my stay here clot
it’s an amazing place well designed anantara style best breakfast buffets i’ve ever seen happy staff
very pleasant hotel beautiful room can say about the location we only stayed there to be close to the airport on our last night in oh same staff is incredibly nice and efficient though
the location
was really good location was perfect staff amazing
bout area seems to be one of the nicest parts of same within it the peace resort felt like an oasis of calm and quality enough facilities breakfast receptionists sunbeam etc for all guests even in busy season
location was good
staff was nicegreat location although a little bit noisy at night can blame the hotel for this its nor their faultroom was clean bed very comfortable and bathroom was nice
pool and bar location with daubed next to beach allows access to all these highlight at a stone’s throw
room  we had a pool vilna it’s great feels like real relaxing place for the family
fantastic resort hotel on oh same possibly the best were ever stayed at the hotel managed to exceed our family of four adults high expectations the property is gorgeous with palm trees and plumerias everywhere and two swimming pools and sea views upon arrival we were greeted with flower bracelets and welcome cocktail very tranquil atmosphere all around due to the small scale of the hotel one doesn have to worry about finding a spot next to the pool or on the beach and the pool boys were excellent free paddleboards and kayaks are available for hotel guests breakfast was wonderful with both a la carte option and a buffets that are included in the room price the restaurant and the pool bar both provided great quality food and drinks and there are many other option within walking distance we tried different sea treatments and they were all superb the hotel offers many activities such as moves on the beach and that nights and the staff was extremely helpful in helping us organize excursions and a rental car all in all we couldn have picked a better place to relax after traveling through the himalayas we also visited some of the other luxury resorts for meals and all agreed ours was the nicest
the location was incredible  the value for the location is a steal  the food was a good price and the service was great and the food was average but very good for the price
excellent location with a short walk to the main strip of shops
the breakfast and location were ok
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest   they replied very fast are easy to find and the pool is nice the rooms are cheap so do not expect  star luxury they let me rent the sooner an additional day even though we had to check out because the hotel was booked out otherwise we would have stayed longer
right on the beach and also in a good location for the bars and entertainment
it’s location was amazing shops bars restaurant etc were only walking distance from the place
it is a good location of you want to be near the airport fro an early morning flight
staff especially data were great perfect location sea service and pool fantastic
good location can get an open back taxi to main strip rooms nice cleaned every day good size to staff are very friendly good pool area
breakfast was great and the location perfect for a family  the free water activities was a really nice touch
good location spacious rooms
our bungalow was perfection  the staff were so friendly and helpful  always smiling  the cottage was spacious and spotless  location was excellent and the sound of the waves pulled us to sleep every evening
indiana is real beach front hotel and in fact this is the best beach at same staff is one of the most valuable thing in a hotel always helpful kind and competentbreakfast is really good indiana maybe is not in a central location in chewing but there are variety of shops and restaurant within  minutes walk from the hotel massage on the beach  is a mustpool is clean and beautifullrooms are clean and spacious we had superior room  maybe aircondition should be a little bit modernhotel is boutique style and that is the huge advantage not very crowded there are enough sun beds for guests at the beach
location and facilities were fine but the wifi was poor
great location friendly staff very clean modern hotel
perfect locationclose to the beach great breakfastgood internet nice pool hotel has everything you need great deal for the money you pay stuff upgrade us from standard room to superior room loved everything about this place
nice location direct on the beach nice restaurant
great location
the location is fantastic just a walk to the beach and also very near to the main markets
small pool area we didn’t struggle to get a bed and it wasn’t crowded but i imagine in high season it is far too small for the number of rooms they have no lift for guests found it sufficient especially as it was included in our room price which was very cheap anyway but there was very little choice at the breakfast buffets
the place was just below an acceptable level of cleanliness the bathroom is small and basic i like a firm bed but this was like sleeping on a sooner table didn find it as noisy at night as people suggest though
there is only  mirror for use which is in the bathroom hence if someone is using the bathroom you cannot use a mirror  i would recommend a mirror in the main room as well plus the bathroom being a open area becomes too hot in summer i would recommend a fan in the bathroom
it has potential to be a lovely resort but the gardens and pool area need a good overhauled as there was debris and leaves rubbish cardboard from new years eve celebrations lying around down by the loungers which were wooden with no fashioning my back was breaking after lying on it
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly
location was a bit secluded but if your going for a relaxing break its perfect
perhaps a little attention to the pool area its a little tiredifferent
shells in the bathroom dusty and rusty bad smell of suffer and humidity hairdryer was burnt air conditioning too loud after we complained we got another room with pleasant smell but still this place needs a takeover
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year
some noise during morning hours due to location
the whole place needs maintenance bad smell from the toilet
each morning someone from guest services would walk through the breakfast area approaching people and ask them about their stay leaving date and so forth this was fine but it was a little irritating having stop eating mid breakfast to have a chat with them each day although we were only there for  days its nice they make the effort to engage with guests and make sure everything is ok so its not a big criticism but we just didn like it
location is poor as you have to take a taxi to the beach not with in walking distance from the hotel
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
food and beverage prices at the hotel were way above the average the bar and pool area were empty instead of happy holidaymakers enjoying themselves with a beer or cocktail especially in the evenings wentnout each nightthey had lots if staff attending the bar but very few peoplewhy wouldn they drop the prices and get the customers
no hot water and everything is very expensive in the restaurant without any reason  one place near the hotel served better food with better atmosphere and with  less price
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody and helpful i would most certainly stay away from this place but i would recommend anyone to the beach i have been to thailand  times now and never have i experienced such a very poor attitude avoid like the plague
food was good but a bit costly location was a bit too far from everything
we got the room far right right next to the place were the staff was always sitting so i could hear them talking well that made it a little uncomfortable like i didn have that feeling of privacy
leaving this wonderful place called tongs bay
chewing beach was very littered with rubbish even if the hotel cleaned the area in front of the hotel the rest of the beach is just bad it is a shame that there are not people cleaning the beach every day as that will make a big impact chewing also becoming a lot like among in pocket where there are shops clubs everywhere some will like this and others wont some maintenance also required for the wood flooring in the rooms but i can imagine visitors with wet feet will create this constantly
i didn realise the apartment would be a bit of a walk from the beach we were on level  beautiful rainforesty view not beach that ok walk down steps and a couple minutes to the beach that due to my expectation that being a beachfront property that it would be very close however as with all resorts best to check beforehand for example the reception area is a long way to the beach  as its a rather large property some of the apartments are a relatively long walk to the beach  consider this if you have small children also consider mobility issues if you need to climb the stairs
the restaurant venue is very limited
closed early very quiet after pm around the pool and bar area
bathroom is nice and clean but isn have many danger and i dont like the way they put shower and toilet in the same place would be better if they have shower curtain
hotel taxi service is too expensive scuttle to nearest market area would be very helpful
the breakfast was soto and could be improved a bit area is very tourist but that chewing and to be expected bathroom was steaming hot as it has open windows and ac doesn work for the bathroom
currently construction underway on the beach side of hotel not lots to do in the immediate area but more close by eg fisherman village and big buddha with transport
the area behind the resort is not very appealing the bar and restaurant are a little over prices
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable
the security of personal belongings and the location
the dining area could have been made more attractive and brighter at night   the gloominess could have led most guests to eat elsewhere at night compared to the numbers at breakfast
impracticable due to the locking of ferries the pool would be ideal for children if they respected the heights the value for money is indecent the same type of structure can be found below the half price  in general i do not recommend it to anyone the worst place of same
the place is very noisy
